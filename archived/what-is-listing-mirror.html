    <h3>Learn more about Listing Mirror, and how we work to partner with your business to sell more, and work less</h3>
        <p>
            We work together with your business to increase sales, and streamline listing management, inventory syncing, and order fulfillment.
            We take great pride in our ability to customize our software for all types of users, no matter the size!
            Beyond simply helping you create your products for the other market, we provide additional services. 
            Our software consists of three pillars that work together for you.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Pillar One: Listing Management</h2>
        <p>
            Firstly, we'll import your listings when you add a marketplace for the first time.
            All your listing data, such as titles, descriptions, images, price, and more, will be stored in a <strong>Product Catalog</strong>. 
            By building this <strong>Product Catalog</strong>, you'll be able to create new products for new markets, using existing data.

        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Pillar Two: Inventory Syncing</h2>
        <p>
            Next, we'll then synchronize your inventory levels between markets.
            If a customer purchases something on one market, we'll let other markets know you have less inventory.
            To avoid having to go to each market individually to update your inventory levels, you'll update them directly on Listing Mirror.

        </p>

        <p>
            If you choose to use another software, you will be able to disable this feature. 
            However, we've found it crucial to ensure that you don't oversell, and allow our tools, such as inventory history, forecasting, and low stock alerts, to function properly.
        </p>
    </div>
<br>
    <h2>Pillar Three: Order Management</h2>
        <p>
            Finally, each marketplace will send your orders to us, where you can then view, fill, and manage them, including Fulfilled By Amazon.
            If you're already using multiple channels, you'll understand how frustrating it can be to log onto each marketplace to manage your orders.
