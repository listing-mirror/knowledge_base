<p> You want to get your multichannel orders into Shopify, to then route to 3PLs (Third Party Logistics) or dropshippers via Shopify apps (or for any other reason). Listing Mirror can do that for you! </p>
<h3>How do I send my orders in Listing Mirror to Shopify?</h3>
<p>1. Open the Integrations tab in the header.</p>
<p>2. Click "Manage Integrations".</p>
<p>3. Click on the Shopify store you would like to update.</p>
<p>4. Open the "Advanced Settings" tab.</p>
<p> 5. Select "Send orders to Shopify". <em>By default all orders will be sent, but you can edit the settings.</em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Can I select which orders go to Shopify?</h3>
<p> Yes! If you are using this connection to fulfill orders via a 3PL or a dropshipping solution, you will likely want us to route certain orders to certain Shopify locations. </p>
<p> You will first want to create an Inventory Source within Listing Mirror. Do this by going to Inventory &gt; Show Inventory Sources. Add a new inventory source with the name of your choosing (for example, the name of your dropshipping solution).&nbsp; </p>
<p> After you have that created, you will want to enable sending orders to Shopify via steps 1-5 found above. Edit the settings and select "Send select orders to specific locations". You will then be prompted to tie a Listing Mirror inventory source to a Shopify location. Learn more about Shopify locations here </p>

<p> The final step needed to get your multichannel orders to Shopify is to set up those inventory sources as enabled fulfillments at the channel level. Learn how to properly set those up by following this guide </p>

<h3> An example of a successful multichannel order being fulfilled by a dropshipping solution. </h3>
<p> Let's say we want our eBay orders fulfilled by our Spocket dropshipping solution. </p>
<p> I would have the Spocket Shopify App downloaded on my account and linked to a <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/locations" target="_self" rel="undefined">Shopify Location</a> named Spocket. </p>
<p> I would set up an inventory source in Listing Mirror using the steps provided above and name it Spocket. </p>
<p> I would create a connection from Listing Mirror's inventory source Spocket to Shopify's location Spocket. </p>
<p> I would then go into my eBay integration and make my Spocket inventory source the first enabled inventory source. This means if there is quantity for that inventory source, we will send that order to Shopify for fulfillment via Spocket. </p>
