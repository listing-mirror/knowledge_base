    <em>Note: Some of our older subscription plans do not include this level of integration. It is possible that you will need to upgrade your plan to have access to inventory integration. Please contact us to enable the function on your account.</em>
  </p>
  <h1>How to Integrate</h1>
  <h2>Step 1</h2>
  <p>
    To integrate SkuVault into Listing Mirror, select&nbsp;<strong>Manage Inventory </strong>from
    the&nbsp;<strong>Integrations&nbsp;</strong>drop-down menu.
  </p>
  <h2>Step 2</h2>
  <p>Next, you will add your SkuVault credentials.</p>
  <h2>Step 3</h2>
  <p>Configuring the integration.</p>
  <p>
    You'll first need to indicate if you'd like for us to connect all of your SkuVault
    warehouses to a single Inventory Source, or to create separate Inventory Sources
    for specific SkuVault warehouses.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    If you choose to connect all of your SkuVault warehouses to a single Inventory
    Source, we will create an Inventory Source called "SkuVault". You will see this
    on your Manage Inventory page.<br>
    <br>
    If you choose to connect select SkuVault warehouses to individual inventory sources,
    we will then prompt you to let us know which warehouses you would like to connect.
    You may select as many SkuVault warehouses as you would like.
  </p>
  <p>
    After connecting those SkuVault warehouses individually, we will create individual
    Inventory Sources named per your SkuVault warehouse name. You will see all of
    these new Inventory Sources on your Manage Inventory page.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Settings for SkuVault integrations</h2>
  <p>1. We sync with SkuVault every two hours.</p>
  <p>
    2. We true up inventory every day of the week at 8am, 2pm, and 10pm UAT. This
    means we will reach out to SkuVault and use their inventory as a guaranteed accurate
    number and sync that quantity to Listing Mirror.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    3. If a SKU is not found in the file that SkuVault gives us, we will zero out
    that SKU's QTY for the SkuVault <strong>Inventory Source.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    Please note, if you use Kitting &amp; Bundling for your listings, you will need
    to set up your recipes in both Listing Mirror and in SkuVault.&nbsp;
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    If you're not already familiar with it, SkuVault is an inventory management system
    with which Listing Mirror integrates.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    There are generally
    <strong>2 workflows for SkuVault to work with Listing Mirror</strong>:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. You can connect all of your SkuVault warehouses to a single Inventory Source,
    and all of your SkuVault inventory will be under the
    <strong>SkuVault </strong>inventory source.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. You can connect select SkuVault warehouses to individual Inventory Sources,
    and they will appear as separate columns on the Manage Inventory page.
  </p>
  <p>
    On top of those specific configurations, there are also two different ways you
    can have SkuVault communicate with Listing Mirror.
  </p>
  <h2>Not Integrated</h2>
  <p>
    If you choose to use SkuVault to manage your inventory, but don't want that inventory
    to sync with Listing Mirror, you would not want to set up an integration. Instead
    you would update your inventory within SkuVault, SkuVault would send that inventory
    information to your marketplaces and Listing Mirror would have no part in managing
    the quantities of your listings.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    If this is the case, make sure your quantity update option is unchecked in your
    integration settings.<img src="/hc/article_attachments/360016593492/Screen_Shot_2018-12-06_at_5.42.06_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2018-12-06_at_5.42.06_PM.png">
  </p>
  <p>
    If that option is enabled, Listing Mirror will send whatever quantity we have,
    even if that quantity is 0.
  </p>
  <p>The other way you can use SkuVault is integrated.</p>
  <h2>Integrated</h2>
  <p>
    If you decide you would like your inventory to sync with Listing Mirror, you
    would want to have your SkuVault account integrated. What this means is that
    you will still maintain your inventory in SkuVault, but instead of SkuVault sending
    the inventory to the marketplace it sends it to Listing Mirror. We will then
    push that inventory out to the marketplaces. In this case, you will want the
    update quantity option to remain selected.
  </p>
  <p>
    This way you can see your listings and inventory all in one convenient place.
    Listing Mirror also frequently updates inventory much quicker than most inventory
    management systems do, so you run less risk of overselling due to inaccurate
    inventory and will&nbsp;<strong>true up</strong> to SkuVault three times every
    single day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that if you use kitting and bundling for your listings, you will want to
    setup Kits in both Listing Mirror and in SkuVault.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    If a SKU is not found in the file that SkuVault gives us, we will zero out that
    SKU's QTY for the SkuVault <strong>Inventory Source.</strong>
