<p> If you would like to change the details of all your products, now you can edit your Product Catalog in bulk. An exciting feature of this spreadsheet is that you can now set your data to be the same as the Product Catalog across all integrations! </p>
<p>
    <strong>Where to find the template</strong>
</p>
<p> Going to our&nbsp; Bulk Edit Templates page, you can download the <strong>Product Edit</strong>&nbsp;template: </p>

</p>
<p> The Product Edit spreadsheet is a little different from the other ones we have:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
    <em>1. Gray columns : </em>Gray columns are ones that should not be filled in. If you fill these out, you will have an error while uploading the spreadsheet. We put in those grey columns because child products don't have some fields, like brand, description or item_length.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <em>2</em>.&nbsp; <em>Actions</em>&nbsp;: On the spreadsheet, there is a third sheet called&nbsp; <strong>Actions</strong>. Using this sheet, you can have the same details, like title or description, across all channel integrations.
</p>
<p> You can do this by changing your input in the&nbsp; <strong>Overwrite on All Integrations</strong>&nbsp;column on the&nbsp; <strong>Actions</strong>&nbsp;sheet. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center">&nbsp;</p>
<p> The default value in this column is&nbsp; <strong>F</strong>, meaning "false". </p>
<p>
    <span class="diff-added">
        <strong>Changing the value to T (for "true") will erase and push the data to be the same as the Product Catalog across all channel integrations.&nbsp;</strong>

    <strong>Template Overview</strong>
</p>
<p> On the first page of the spreadsheet, ProductEdit, you can fill in all the fields that you would normally enter in your Listing Mirror account.&nbsp; </p>
<p> The second page of the spreadsheet is the Lookup page, for internal purposes. Please do not delete or edit this page. If you do, you will get an error when you upload the template.&nbsp; </p>
<p> The third page is Actions, as explained in <strong>New features</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p> If you would prefer to change details in your Listing Mirror account and not on a spreadsheet, you can do that in the Product page on Listing Mirror directly.&nbsp; </p>
