            Walmart never deletes a listing, even if you delete it from their website.
            All listings are considered "retired" when you remove them from your account.
            This error will occur when you attempt to start selling something again under a different SKU, but still use the same Product ID.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our software attempts to switch to the new SKU on your behalf, but, rarely, Walmart might reject the change.
            Follow the instructions below to resolve the issue.
        </p>
    <div class="LM-Info">
        <p>
            Walmart defines <strong>Product ID</strong> as any barcode.
            This can include UPC, GTIN, ISBN, or EAN.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
            To resolve the issue, you'll need to log into your Walmart account and change the SKU of the offending listing.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Log into your <a href="https://seller.walmart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart seller account</a>.</li>
            <li>Under <strong>Product Catalog</strong>, click <strong>Items</strong>.</li>
            <li>Enable <strong>Include Retired Items</strong>.</li>
                <img src="./assets/walmart-error-retired-listings.png">
            <li>Search for the previous SKU, Item ID (barcode), or Item Name.</li>
            <li>Edit the item, changing the old SKU to match the SKU in Listing Mirror.</li>
            <li>Submit changes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Back on Listing Mirror, click <strong>Save Changes</strong> to initiate the update.
            Please allow up to 24 hours for Walmart to accept the change, and provide us with the update.
