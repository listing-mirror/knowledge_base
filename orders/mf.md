# Getting Started: Merchant Fulfilled Orders
### Learn how we handle your merchant fulfilled orders


Regardless of how you fill your orders, Listing Mirror will import any orders made on a marketplace. This allows us to not only adjust your quantity in real time, but allows you to see order information in one place. The orders page has many options for you to manage your orders. 

## Order Details

## Cancelling Orders

Cancelling an order is a straightforward process, but it's importing to know what happens to the quantity. As a reminder, if you cancel an order through Listing Mirror, the quantity **will not** be returned. You'll need to adjust this manually.

1. From the menubar, click **Orders**, followed by **Show All Orders**. 
2. Search for, or click on the order number you need to cancel. 
3. Click the **Actions** dropdown, followed by **Cancel Order On Market**.

Keep in mind, this is only possible for Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Shop On Google, Shopify, and Newegg. If your desired marketplace isn't on this list, you'll need to cancel the order on the marketplace itself. 
As a reminder, if the order is cancelled on the market, either by you, or the customer, the quantity **will** be returned.

**NOTE:** If you use ShipStation, you'll need to make sure they refund your shipping label. [Learn more](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026157751-Void-Labels)

## Refunding Orders

## Fulfillment Actions

If you receieve a merchant fulfilled order, and decide that you want to use FBA or Deliverr to fill it instead, we give you the option to send the order to that inventory source. If Amazon or Deliverr are unable to fulfill the order, we'll let you know why.

1. From the menubar, click **Orders**, followed by **Show All Orders**. 
2. Search for the order number you need to manage.
3. Under the **Fulfillment Options** column, click the FBA, or Deliverr icon.

You can also find these optiosn on the **Order Details** page, under the **Actions** dropdown. 

## Splitting Orders

Splitting an order can be done if a customer buys two items, and you want to send one to FBA or Deliverr. 

1. From the menubar, click **Orders**, followed by **Show All Orders**. 
2. Search for, or click on the order number you need to split. 
3. Click the **Actions** dropdown, followed by **Split Order**.
4. On the following screen, input the quantity in the box that you want to split, followed by **Split Order**.

Once the order is split, you'll now have multiple orders. Going to any of the orders will show you the intial order it was split from. 
We have the ability to automaticaly split orders that have an MF and FBA / Deliverr order. [Learn more](/mcf)

**NOTE:** Listing Mirror will not notify the market that the item has shipped until all parts of the order have shipped. 

## Order Statuses

On the orders page, we'll display order statuses based on the inventory source. For merchant fulfilled orders, you may see one of the options below.

- Unpaid: The customer has yet to pay for the order.
- Pending: The order has been paid for, but the market is still processing the order. 
- Accepted: Listing Mirror has accepted this order, commiting you to filling this order.
- Cancelled: The order has been cancelled in **Listing Mirror**.
- Complete: Tracking information has been added to the order in Listing Mirror, and we've sent that data to the marketplace. 

If you use a fulfillment service not connected to Listing Mirror, a majority of your orders will be listed as **Accepted** indefinitely. To resolve this, you'll need to either connect your fuilfillment service to Listing Mirror using our [API](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047894192), or by uploading tracking data from your fulfillment service to Listing Mirror.
