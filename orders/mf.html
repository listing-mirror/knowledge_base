<h1>Getting Started | Merchant Fulfilled Orders</h1>
            <!-- Add everything below this line to Zendesk. Above is only for this website.-->
<h3>Learn how to view, manage, and edit orders made using your business's warehouse inventory</h3>
    <p>No matter what tool you use to fill your orders, we'll import them to view. This ensures your quantity is properly reflected, and gives you a place to see all your orders in one spot.</p>
<br>
<h2>Cancelling Orders</h2>
    <p>When cancelling orders, it's import to understand where quantity will go. An order cancelled on Listing Mirror <strong>will not</strong> return the quantity.</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Orders</strong>, followed by <strong>Show All Orders</strong>.</li>
        <li>Search for an order number and click it.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown, followed by <strong>Cancel Order On Market</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This feature is available for Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Google, Shopify, and Newegg. Any marketplace not listed will need to be cancelled on the market. Cancelling an order on the market <strong>will</strong> return quantity.</p>
    <p>Please note, if you use ShipStation, you'll need to ensure they refund your shipping label. <a href="https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026157751" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
<br>
<h2>Refunding Orders</h2>
    <p>Walmart is the only market that supports this feature.</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Orders</strong>, followed by <strong>Show Returns</strong>.</li>
        <li>Locate the appropriate return, and click <strong>Details</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Issue Refund</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The item refunded will be dealt with based on your Walmart settings. You can also use Listing Mirror to override those settings using the <strong>Override Return Options</strong> checkbox.</p>
<br>
<h2>Fulfillment Actions</h2>
    <p>When you receive a merchant fulfilled order, we provide you with quick options to fulfilling this via 3PL. If the 3PL is unable to fill the other, we'll let you know why.</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Orders</strong>, followed by <strong>Show All Orders</strong>.</li>
        <li>Search for an order.</li>
        <li>Under the <strong>Fulfillment Options</strong> column, click any 3PL icon.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These options can also be found under the <strong>Order Details</strong> page, using the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown.</p>
<br>
<h2>Splitting Orders</h2>
    <p>If an order has multiple products from different inventory sources, you can split the order and fulfill them using different 3PL sources.</p>
    <p>Please note, the market will <strong>not</strong> be notified until ALL split orders have shipped.</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Orders</strong>, followed by <strong>Show All Orders</strong>.</li>
        <li>Search for an order, and click on the order number.</li>
        <li>Using the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown, click <strong>Split Order</strong>.</li>
        <li>Input the quantity you want to split, followed by <strong>Split Order</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you'd like to automate this process, you can enable <strong>Autos-Split Fulfillment</strong> in your integration settings. <a href="https://listing-mirror.github.io/training-centre/orders/mcf" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
<br>
<h2>Order Status</h2>
    <p>On the orders page, we'll display the status of your orders.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unpaid</strong>: The order has not been paid for.</li>
        <li><strong>Pending</strong>: The order has not accepted, or the market is still processing the order.</li>
        <li><strong>Accepted</strong>: The order has been accepted, committing you to fulfillment.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancelled</strong>: The order has been cancelled by you, or the customer.</li>
        <li><strong>Complete</strong>: The order has been filled, and tracking information has been provided to the market.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your fulfillment service isn't connected with Listing Mirror, your merchant fulfilled orders will remain <strong>Accepted</strong> indefinitely. You'll need to connect your fulfillment service to Listing Mirror, or manually input tracking details.</p>
