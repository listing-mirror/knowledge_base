    <h3>Learn how to view, manage, and edit orders made using your business's warehouse inventory</h3>
        <p>
            No matter what tool you use to fill your orders, we'll import them to view. 
            This ensures your quantity is properly reflected, and gives you a place to see all your orders in one spot.
        </p>

    <h2>Cancel Orders</h2>
        <p>
            When cancelling orders, it's import to understand where quantity will go.
            An order cancelled on Listing Mirror will give you the option to add the quantity back to your inventory or not.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Orders</strong>, followed by <strong>Show All Orders</strong>.</li>
            <li>Search for an order number and click it.</li>
            <li>Click the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown, followed by <strong>Cancel Order On Market</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This feature is available for Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Google, Shopify, and Newegg.
            Any marketplace not listed will need to be cancelled on the market.
            Cancelling an order on the market <strong>will</strong> return quantity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note, if you use ShipStation, you'll need to ensure they refund your shipping label.

    <h2>Refund Orders</h2>
        <p>
            Walmart is the only market that supports this feature.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Orders</strong>, followed by <strong>Show Returns</strong>.</li>
            <li>Locate the appropriate return, and click <strong>Details</strong>.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Issue Refund</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The item refunded will be dealt with based on your Walmart settings.
            You can also use Listing Mirror to override those settings using the <strong>Override Return Options</strong> checkbox.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Fulfillment Actions</h2>
        <p>
            When you receive a merchant fulfilled order, we provide you with quick options to fulfilling this via third-party logistics.
            If the third-party logistics is unable to fill the other, we'll let you know why in your notification center.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Orders</strong>, followed by <strong>Show All Orders</strong>.</li>
            <li>Search for an order.</li>
            <li>Under the <strong>Fulfillment Options</strong> column, click any third-party logistics icon.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            These options can also be found under the <strong>Order Details</strong> page, using the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Order Status</h2>
        <p>
            On the orders page, we'll display the status of your orders.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unpaid</strong>: The order has not been paid for.</li>
            <li><strong>Pending</strong>: The order has not been accepted, or the market is still processing the order.</li>
            <li><strong>Accepted</strong>: The order has been accepted, committing you to fulfillment.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancelled</strong>: The order has been cancelled by you, or the customer.</li>
            <li><strong>Complete</strong>: The order has been filled, and tracking information has been provided to the market.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If your fulfillment service isn't connected with Listing Mirror, your merchant fulfilled orders will remain <strong>Accepted</strong> indefinitely.
            You'll need to connect your fulfillment service to Listing Mirror, or manually input tracking details.
