# Getting Started: Multi-Channel Fulfillment
### Learn how we manage your Multi-Channel Fulfillment orders 

Much like merchant fulfilled orders, Listing Mirror will import your multi-channel fulfillemnt orders, and send them to the correct platform for fulfillment. The orders page has many options for you to manage your orders.

## Cancelling Orders

Cancelling an MCF order is similar to cancelling an MF order. Should you catch the order before it's sent to Amazon or your 3PL, you can cancel the MCF process.

1. From the menubar, click **Orders**, followed by **Show All Orders**. 
2. Search for the order number you need to cancel. 
3. Under the **Fulfillment Actions** column, click **Cancel MCF**.

Once the order has been removed from MCF, you'll need to cancel the order as you would any MF order. [Learn more](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045500772)

## Returns

To manage your MCF returns first, you will have to log in to your Amazon seller account. Anytime that you have an MCF return you will have to create a custom return. On your custom return, you can choose to send the item back to the FBA warehouse or your MF warehouse.   

### Creating Returns

1. From your Amazon seller account, go to **Orders**, followed by **Manage Orders**.
2. Click **Advanced Search**.
3. In the **search dropdown list**, make sure Order ID is selected. 
4. In the **Search Order ID** text box, enter the Order ID for the item to be returned, then click **Search**.
5. On the **Manage Orders** page click the **Order ID**.
6. On the **Order Details** page, click the **Create Customer Return** tab.
7. For each item in the order to be returned, select **Return Quantity** and **Return Reason**.
8. Click **Submit** to generate the RMA and return shipping label.
9. Send the RMA and shipping label to your customer so they can prepare the return package.
 
## Tracking Returns

1. Follow steps 1-5 above.
2. On the **Order Details** page, click the **Return Status** tab to view the status of a return.
3. After the return package is processed at a fulfillment center, the return status will show as **Processed**. If the item is, for example, damaged by the customer, there will be additional details in the **Disposition** column.

## Splitting Orders Automatically

As described in the [Merchant Fulfilled](mf) portion, we have the ability to split orders. If you don't want to split them manually for orders that contain an MCF & MF order, you can enable the **Auto-Split Fulfillment** option on a per integration basis.

1. From the menubar, click **Integrations**, followed by **Manage Integrations**.
2. Select the marketplace of your choice.
3. Click on the **Inventory** tab.
4. Enabled **Auto-Split Fulfillment**.

This is a great time saver for business owners who want to increase their chances of orders being fulfilled via FBA, and reduce the number of times they have to fulfill the order manually. You also won't have to rely on manually splitting orders to get your order shipped to the customer in a timely manner!

## Order Statuses

On the orders page, we'll display order statuses based on the inventory source. For Multi-Channel Fulfillment orders, you may see one of the options below.

- **Won't Fill:** We've sent this order to your MCF platform, but they can't fill the order. We usually send an email for this, but may require you to manually fill the order using the **Fulfillment Actions** column.
- **Awaiting Fulfillment:** This order is planned to be filled, by hasn't been sent to your MCF platform yet.
- **Filled, Awaiting Tracking:** Your MCF platform has filled the order, and we're waiting for them to send us tracking information.
- **Partially Filled:** Your MCF platform has provided some tracking details, but we're missing details for other parts of the order.
- **Fully Filled:** Your MCF platform has provided us with tracking details, and has sent the item to the customer. We've sent the tracking details to the market, who send it to the customer.
