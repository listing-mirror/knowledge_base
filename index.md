# Welcome to the Training Centre

Welcome to Listing Mirror, we're happy to have you here! The training centre will help you achieve your goals of multi-channel listing management.

NOTE: This page is intended for Listing Mirror staff only. This is a DEMO, and will not be used as the live version, even after completion. If you're looking for the client-facing Training Centre, please view the page on our website. [Learn more](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/categories/360004804391)

Also, I didn't feel like writing some CSS for this, so it's just going to be static pages. Really takes you back, huh?
