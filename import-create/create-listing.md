# Getting Started: Creating Listings
### Learn how to create listings in Listing Mirror, and set expectations for the accepted workflow

Unlike Amazon, we don't run automatic import for any other marketplace. As stated before, you'll be expected to create brand-new products on Listing Mirror. This article will show you how to create products without any existing information. 

## Create Listings Without Data

1. From the **Manage Listings** page, click **Add New Product** at the top right.
2. Fill out the SKU, title, and condition fields, and click **Confirm**.
3. Search for the SKU or title you just created, and click on the **Product Catalogue** for the created product.
4. Fill out the required details, such as description, category, price. You can also fill out any other fields you may need.
5. Under **Market Listings**, click the plus button for any markets you need to add this product to.

You can also create variations, and update variation information from this page, should you need to do so. Any information you put into the fields in this page will be in sync across all markets.
