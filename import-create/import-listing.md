# Getting Started: Importing Listings
### Learn how Listing Mirror brings in your products, and our expectations for the accepted workflow

Welcome to Listing Mirror, we're happy to have you here! During the course of the training, we'll explain how to use our software, what to expect, and how you can overcome foreseen obstacles.

## Bringing In Your Products
When you connect a marketplace for the first time, we'll bring in the listings you currently have on that market, should they meet our import criteria. We'll go over the most common markets here, but you can view our article on the topic for a full list. [Learn more](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021623032)

### Amazon
The listings must be **active**, have **quantity**, and have a **unique SKU**.
### eBay
The listings must be **active**, and have a **unique SKU**. 
### Walmart
The listings must have a **unique SKU**, and **unique Product ID** (UPC, GTIN, EAN, ISBN).
### Shopify
The listings must have a **unique SKU**.

Once your listings have been imported, we'll continue to import new products from Amazon and WooCommerce every two hours, under the same critera. Please note, that once you've imported your listings, we won't run an import again for any non-Amazon or WooCommerce listings. **Moving forward, you'll be expected to create new listings within Listing Mirror.**
