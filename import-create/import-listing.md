# Getting Started: Importing Listings
### Learn how Listing Mirror brings in your products after you connect your marketplace

While this process typically works without issue, there can be fringe cases you may run into complications. 

## Bringing In Your Products
When you connect a marketplace for the first time, we'll bring in the listings you currently have on that market, should they meet our import criteria. We'll go over the most common markets here, but you can view our article on the topic for a full list. [Learn more](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021623032)

### Amazon
The listings must be **active**, have **quantity**, and have a **unique SKU**.
### eBay
The listings must be **active**, and have a **unique SKU**. 
### Walmart
The listings must have a **unique SKU**, and **unique Product ID** (UPC, GTIN, EAN, ISBN).
### Shopify
The listings must have a **unique SKU**.

Once your listings have been imported, we'll continue to import new products from Amazon and WooCommerce every two hours, under the same critera. Please note, that once you've imported your listings, we won't run an import again for any non-Amazon or WooCommerce listings. **Moving forward, you'll be expected to create new listings within Listing Mirror.** 

As long as your SKUs are matching across all platforms, they're be linked together on the Product Catalogue, and no extra work will need to be done. **If you have different SKUs for the same product, you will need to link them together**.

## Importing Walmart & Newegg Listings

The API for these marketplaces provides us with an incomplete set of data. Meaning, when we import your listings, we may not grab all of the data. This creates a problem when Listing Mirror controls your listing data, as we'd send back to the market that a field is blank when it might not be. We do everything we can do prevent data loss for your business. [Learn more](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/360054125091)
