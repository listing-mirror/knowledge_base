    <h2>Importing Your Products</h2>
        <p>
            When you connect a marketplace for the first time, we'll import any listings you have on the market, should they meet the import requirements.

    <h3>Import Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            In general, we require all products to have a unique SKU to import.
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amazon</strong>: Products must be <strong>active</strong>, and have <strong>quantity</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>eBay</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Walmart</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique product identifier</strong>, such as a UPC, ISBN, EAN, or GTIN</li>
                <li><strong>Shopify</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Once imported, we'll continue to import new products from <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>WooCommerce</strong> every two hours.
            For other marketplaces, no other imports will be run.
            <strong>You'll be expected to create new products on Listing Mirror</strong>.
        </p>
    <p>
        If your SKUs are matching across all marketplaces, they'll be linked together on the <strong>Product Catalog</strong>.
        If your SKUs differ, you'll need to link them together.

    <h2>Walmart & Newegg Products</h2>
        <p>
            These markets provide third-parties with incomplete data. When imported, some information may be missed.
            Since Listing Mirror controls your listing data, we combat potential data loss by making these products <strong>not editable</strong> until you consent.
