### Amazon Inventory File Templates (Flatfile Uploads)
Flatfiles are something that Amazon provides, and exist independant of Listing Mirror. If you upload the Flatfile to Listing Mirror, we'll pass the information to Amazon for the listings to be created, but you get the added benefit of having the listing information available in Listing Mirror much faster. This will allow you to create the listing on multiple channels quicker than waiting for an import. [Learn more](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027267831)

### Add Products Directly To Amazon
If those two options don't work for you, we do have a solution, as we know Inventory File Templates aren't available to everyone. We run an import every two hours of anything on your Amazon seller account that meets the import critera. As a reminder, the critera for import is: The listing must be active and have quantity on your Amazon seller account.
