# Getting Started: Mirror From Amazon to eBay
### Learn how to mirror your Amazon listings to eBay using Listing Mirror

One of the pillars of Listing Mirror, is mirroring listings from one market to another. We use our Product Catalogue to pull in your information from Amazon, and send it out to other markets with ease. Before jumping into things, we recommend reading over some common pitfalls you might run into when doing so. Missing out on these details could lead to your listings not going live immedaitely. 

## New To eBay? 
If you're new to eBay, eBay imposes limits on new sellers. [Learn more](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107)

Listing Mirror provides you a way get around these limits, but limiting how much you inventory you post to eBay.

1. From the **Manage Integrations** page, open your eBay marketplace.
2. Select the **Inventory** tab, at the top of the page.
3. Scroll down to **Max Quantity**, and set this to a reasonable number. We suggest anywhere from one to three.

This allows you to bypass limits, such as how much inventory you're allowed to post to eBay. While you may have more than the max quantity set, we'll always tell eBay you're selling that much. If you're selling one-hundred hats, but set your max quantity to 5, we'll always tell eBay you have five. 

## eBay Business Policies
If you're new to eBay, you will need to set these up before you start making eBay listings in Listing Mirror. Failing to do so will most likely result in an error, preventing the listing from going live. [Learn more](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/business-policy/business-policies?id=4212)

Once you have your business policies created, or, you're already established on eBay and don't need to create them, you'll want to set your defaults. These will apply to all newly created eBay listings.

If you need to change any of your three profiles for a given listing, we have the option to change that on the market listing page for a given eBay listing.

Once your listings are created, you'll see one of these errors if your business policies aren't assigned properly: 

- At least one valid shipping service must be specified.
- At least one valid return service must be specified.
- At least one valid payment service must be specified.

## Missing Category Fields
Once you've mirrored your listings from Amazon to eBay, certain fields will need to be filled out for the listings to go live. eBay requires category specifications to be filled out, such as **Type**. This is one of the most common eBay errors that people will run into. You'll see errors such as:

- The item specific Type is missing. Add Type to this listing, enter a valid value, and then try again.
- The item specific Brand is missing. Add Brand to this listing, enter a valid value, and then try again.
- The item specific Size is missing. Add Size to this listing, enter a valid value, and then try again.

There are two ways you can solve these issues:

### Individual Listings
If you've only mirrored a few listings, you can do this from the market listing. 

1. Open the market listing that has the error. 
2. Select the **Category** tab.
3. Locate the field in question, and fill out the information.

The fields should have a red asterisks next to them, incidicating that they're required.
