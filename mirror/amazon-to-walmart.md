# Getting Started: Mirror From Amazon to Walmart
### Learn how to mirror your Amazon listings to Walmart using Listing Mirror

One of the pillars of Listing Mirror, is mirroring listings from one market to another. We use our Product Catalogue to pull in your information from Amazon, and send it out to other markets with ease. Before jumping into things, we recommend reading over some common pitfalls you might run into when doing so. Missing out on these details could lead to your listings not going live immedaitely. 

## Common Pitfalls: Missing GTIN/UPC/EAN/ISBN

Before creating listings on Walmart, we recommend grabbing the product identifiers for your listings, and upload them to the **Product Catalogue**. 

Due to restrictions imposed by Amazon, we're unable to import your these from your Amazon listings. [Learn more](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057398092)

Walmart requires these fields on all listings, so you'll need to find a way to export those from your Amazon listings. We have a guide on how to find them on [Amazon using an ASIN](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/4473366849947) or on [Walmart using your browser](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009636071). 

Now that you have your UPCs for your products, you'll need to get them into your listing data. You can do this individually, or use a template.

## Individual Listings

1. On the **Manage Listings**, find the listing you want to update, and click on the **Product Catalogue**.
2. Locate the **UPC** field. If you need to update the GTIN, EAN, or ISBN, click **Add** in the identifier box.
3. Enter the UPC, and **Save Changes**.

That will send the UPC to not only Walmart, but every market that has the field. 


## Bulk Edit Templates

1. From the **Listing** tab on the menubar, click **Bulk Edit Templates**.
2. Locate the **UPC Update** template, and click **Download**.
3. Open the spreadsheet, and update the **Master UPC** column with the UPC that coorisponds with the SKU. 
4. Save Changes, then **Upload** the template back on the Bulk Edit Templates page.

After you upload the sheet, the product catalogue will send the UPC to every market you have connected.
