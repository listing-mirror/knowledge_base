# Getting Started: Mirror From Amazon to Walmart
### Learn how to mirror your Amazon listings to eBay using Listing Mirror

One of the pillars of Listing Mirror, is mirroring listings from one market to another. We use our Product Catalogue to pull in your information from Amazon, and send it out to other markets with ease. Before jumping into things, we recommend reading over some common pitfalls you might run into when doing so. Missing out on these details could lead to your listings not going live immedaitely.

Due to restrictions imposed by Amazon, we're unable to import your these from your Amazon listings. [Learn more](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057398092)

Walmart requires these fields on all listings, so you'll need to find a way to export those from your Amazon listings. We have a guide on how to find them on [Amazon using an ASIN](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/4473366849947) or on [Walmart using your browser](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009636071). 

Now that you have your UPCs for your products, you'll need to get them into your listing data. You can do this individually, or use a template.
