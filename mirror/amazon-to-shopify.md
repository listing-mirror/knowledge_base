Before jumping into things, we recommend reading over some common pitfalls you might run into when doing so. Missing out on these details could lead to your listings not going live immedaitely. 

## Getting Started: Inventory Locations

Listing Mirror will be sending your inventory to Shopify, so these will need to be set up properly. [Learn more](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045085192)

Listing Mirror will then send all quantity updates to this inventory location.

### Additional Locations

Rarely, you may have multiple warehouses connected to your Shopify account. You can assign up to two extra locations on Listing Mirror.
Before setting these locations, you'll need to create one or two more inventory sources. 

1. From the menubar, click **Inventory**, followed by **Show Inventory Sources**.
2. Click **Add New Inventory Source**, and fill out the information.
3. Click **Add Inventory Source**.

If you have two locations you need to add, repeat this process a following time. 

1. Click **Integrations** on the menubar, followed by **Manage Integrations**. 
2. Click your **Shopify** integration, and head to the **Advanced** tab.
