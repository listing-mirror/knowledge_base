# Getting Started: Mirror From Amazon to Shopify
### Learn how to mirror your Amazon listings to Shopify using Listing Mirror

One of the pillars of Listing Mirror, is mirroring listings from one market to another. We use our Product Catalogue to pull in your information from Amazon, and send it out to other markets with ease. Before jumping into things, we recommend reading over some common pitfalls you might run into when doing so. Missing out on these details could lead to your listings not going live immedaitely. 

## Getting Started: Inventory Locations

Shopify works slightly different than other markets. Shopify allows you to have multiple inventory sources within their platform. Listing Mirror will be sending your inventory to Shopify, so these will need to be set up properly. [Learn more](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045085192)

### Setting Defaults

When you add your Shopify integration for the first time, you'll be asked to set this location. If you need to change it, or see what you set it to, follow these steps.

1. Click **Integrations** on the menubar, followed by **Manage Integrations**. 
2. Select your **Shopify** integration.
3. From the **Locations** dropdown, select the main location assigned to your Shopify account.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

Listing Mirror will then send all quantity updates to this inventory location.

### Additional Locations

Rarely, you may have multiple warehouses connected to your Shopify account. You can assign up to two extra locations on Listing Mirror.
Before setting these locations, you'll need to create one or two more inventory sources. 

1. From the menubar, click **Inventory**, followed by **Show Inventory Sources**.
2. Click **Add New Inventory Source**, and fill out the information.
3. Click **Add Inventory Source**.

If you have two locations you need to add, repeat this process a following time. 

1. Click **Integrations** on the menubar, followed by **Manage Integrations**. 
2. Click your **Shopify** integration, and head to the **Advanced** tab.
3. From the dropdown, **Location Additional 1**, select your first Shopify location.
4. from the dropdown, **Inventory Source Additional 1**, select your Listing Mirror inventory source.

If you have two locations you need to add, repeat this process a following time. 

## Listing Creation Process
Now that you know about Shopify locations, let's talk about mirroring the listings. Keep in mind, if you're still in your trial peroid with Listing Mirror, you can only create 100 SKUs on our platform. You have three ways you can go about this:

### Individual Listings
This is the best option if you're looking to test out the waters and see what a listing will look like from Amazon. 

1. From the **Manage Listings** page, find a listing you'd like to mirror. 
2. Under eBay, click the **Add to Marketplace** button, outlined by a blue plus. 

That's it! Assuming there's no issues, your listing will be live in less than a minute. 

### In Bulk - Manage Listings Page
Ready to jump into a larger group? 

1. From the **Manage Listings** page, select the SKUs you want to mirror on the left via the checkbox.
2. Using the dropdown above, click **Create**. 
3. Click **Shopify**, and click confirm. 

Simple. Clicking **Select All** will give you the entire page worth of listings. By default, this is 50. We also give you the ability to **Select All # Listings**, if you'd like to mirror them all at once.

### In Bulk - Bulk Edit Templates
Prefer spreadsheets? 

1. On the menubar, click **Listings**, followed by **Bulk Edit Templates**
2. From the dropdown, select **Create and Delete**, and click **Download**.
3. On the sheet, you'll see cells marked **E**, which means they exist. In the empty cells, put a **C** for listings you want to **Create**.
4. Head back to the **Bulk Edit Templates** page, and upload the sheet.

You can view the status of the spreadsheet in the [Bulk Upload History page](https://reflector.listingmirror.com/report/bulk-history/).
