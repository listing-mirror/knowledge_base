Before jumping into things, we recommend reading over some common pitfalls you might run into when doing so. Missing out on these details could lead to your listings not going live immedaitely. 

## Common Pitfalls: Fixed Prie Shipping Profile

Before you can post things to Etsy using Listing Mirror, you must have a shipping profile created on Etsy. If you have existing listing on Etsy, they must have a shipping profile before Listing Mirror will import them. To create a **Fixed Price Shipping Profile**, follow the steps below.

1. On Etsy's website, head to your account settings.
2. Click **Shop Manager**, followed by **Settings**, followed by **Shipping Settings**.
3. Click **Add A Shipping Profile**
4. Fill out the profile as you wish.
