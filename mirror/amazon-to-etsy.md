# Getting Started: Mirror From Amazon to Etsy
### Learn how to mirror your Amazon listings to Etsy using Listing Mirror

One of the pillars of Listing Mirror, is mirroring listings from one market to another. We use our Product Catalogue to pull in your information from Amazon, and send it out to other markets with ease. Before jumping into things, we recommend reading over some common pitfalls you might run into when doing so. Missing out on these details could lead to your listings not going live immedaitely. 

## Common Pitfalls: Fixed Prie Shipping Profile

Before you can post things to Etsy using Listing Mirror, you must have a shipping profile created on Etsy. If you have existing listing on Etsy, they must have a shipping profile before Listing Mirror will import them. To create a **Fixed Price Shipping Profile**, follow the steps below.

1. On Etsy's website, head to your account settings.
2. Click **Shop Manager**, followed by **Settings**, followed by **Shipping Settings**.
3. Click **Add A Shipping Profile**
4. Fill out the profile as you wish.

Etsy will then send this shipping profile to Listing Mirror, where you can assign them to your Etsy listings. 

## Listing Creation Process
Now that you know about Etsy's shipping profile, let's talk about mirroring the listings. Keep in mind, if you're still in your trial peroid with Listing Mirror, you can only create 100 SKUs on our platform. You have three ways you can go about this:

### Individual Listings
This is the best option if you're looking to test out the waters and see what a listing will look like from Amazon. 

1. From the **Manage Listings** page, find a listing you'd like to mirror. 
2. Under eBay, click the **Add to Marketplace** button, outlined by a blue plus. 

That's it! Assuming there's no issues, your listing will be live in less than a minute. 

### In Bulk - Manage Listings Page
Ready to jump into a larger group? 

1. From the **Manage Listings** page, select the SKUs you want to mirror on the left via the checkbox.
2. Using the dropdown above, click **Create**. 
3. Click **Etsy**, and click confirm. 

Simple. Clicking **Select All** will give you the entire page worth of listings. By default, this is 50. We also give you the ability to **Select All # Listings**, if you'd like to mirror them all at once.

### In Bulk - Bulk Edit Templates

1. On the menubar, click **Listings**, followed by **Bulk Edit Templates**
2. From the dropdown, select **Create and Delete**, and click **Download**.
3. On the sheet, you'll see cells marked **E**, which means they exist. In the empty cells, put a **C** for listings you want to **Create**.
