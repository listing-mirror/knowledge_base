    <h2>Learn how to use the data from your other market listings to create new Shopify listings, avoiding common pitfalls</h2>
        <p>
            To begin, it is essential to ensure that your Shopify seller account and Shopify integration settings are correctly configured.
            Neglecting to do so may prevent your listings from going live.

    <h3>Define your Shopify inventory locations</h3>
        <p>
            Shopify offers the convenience of having multiple inventory locations on their platform.
            For us to successfully send your inventory to Shopify, it is necessary for you to assign a Listing Mirror inventory source to each location.
        </p>
    <h4>Default Location</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Integrations</strong>, followed by <strong>Manage Integrations</strong>.</li>
            <li>Click a <strong>Shopify</strong> integration.</li>
            <li>From the <strong>Locations</strong> dropdown, select the main location assigned to your Shopify account.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Additional Location</h4>
        <p>
            If you have multiple locations, you can create up to two extra inventory sources to accommodate this.
