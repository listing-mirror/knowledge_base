    <h2>Learn how to use the data from your other market listings to create new Shopify listings, avoiding common pitfalls</h2>
        <p>
            Using your <strong>Product Catalog</strong> data, we build your Shopify listings with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before getting started, you'll have to ensure your Shopify locations are properly set up.
            Failing to do so can result in your listings not going live.
        </p>

    <h3>Define your Shopify inventory locations</h3>
        <p>
            Shopify allows multiple inventory sources on their platform.
            Since we send your inventory to Shopify, you'll have to assign a Listing Mirror inventory source to location.
        </p>
    <h4>Default Location</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Integrations</strong>, followed by <strong>Manage Integrations</strong>.</li>
            <li>Click a <strong>Shopify</strong> integration.</li>
            <li>From the <strong>Locations</strong> dropdown, select the main location assigned to your Shopify account.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Additional Location</h4>
        <p>
            If you have multiple locations, you can create two extra inventory sources to accommodate this.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Inventory</strong>, followed by <strong>Inventory Sources</strong>.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Add New Inventory Source</strong>, and fill out the required information.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Add Inventory Source</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            After, you'll assign the inventory sources to the Shopify locations.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Integrations</strong>, followed by <strong>Manage Integrations</strong>.</li>
            <li>Click a <strong>Shopify</strong> integration, followed by the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.</li>
            <li>From the <strong>Location Additional 1</strong> dropdown, select a Shopify location.</li>
            <li>From the <strong>Inventory Source Additional 1</strong>, select your inventory source.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>List your products to Shopify</h3>
    <h4>Create Individual Listings</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>From the <strong>Manage Listings</strong> page, find a product missing from Shopify.</li>
            <li>Click the blue <strong>Add to Marketplace</strong> button.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If there are no issues, and you're syncing, the listing will go live.
        </p>
    <h4>Create Multiple Listings</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>From the <strong>Manage Listings</strong> page, find a group of missing products on Shopify.</li>
            <li>On the left, click the checkbox for each listing you'd like to create.</li>
            <li>Using the dropdown, click <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
            <li>Click the Shopify checkbox, then hit <strong>Confirm</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Depending on the number of listings created, it may take up to a minute to display them all.
        </p>
    <h4>Create Multiple Listings Using Templates</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Listings</strong>, followed by <strong>Bulk Edit Templates</strong>.</li>
            <li>From the dropdown, select <strong>Create and Delete</strong>, followed by <strong>Download Template</strong>.</li>
            <li>Once downloaded, open the sheet and input <strong>C</strong> in the marketplace column and SKU row for the desired product.</li>
            <li>Save the sheet, head back to the <strong>Bulk Edit Templates</strong>, and click <strong>Upload Template</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
