            Once you've created or imported an Amazon listing, the assigned category will be mapped to the most appropriate category on another marketplace.

            To get started, click <strong>Listings</strong> on the menu bar and choose your preferred region under <strong>Category Mapping</strong>.

    <h3>Assign your default category mappings</h3>

            If there's a category you want your listings assigned to, you can select a default for each marketplace.
            Any listings that doesn't have a specific mapping will be assigned this category.
