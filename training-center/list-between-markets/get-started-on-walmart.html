    <h2>Learn how to use the data from your other market listings to create new Walmart listings, avoiding common pitfalls</h2>
        <p>
            To successfully begin your Walmart journey, it is crucial that your product information meets Walmart's requirements.
            Our comprehensive guide will instruct you on the essential information you need, where to find it, and the most efficient method of entering data.
        </p>
    <h3>Common Pitfall: Missing UPC, GTIN, EAN, or ISBN</h3>
        <p>
            Walmart requires all listings to have a barcode, which they defined as a <strong>Product Identifier</strong>.
            If any marketplace you've integrated with us has this information, it will already be in your <strong>Product Catalog</strong>.
            However, if it's missing, you'll need to locate the barcode elsewhere.

            Now that you have collected the necessary information, it's time to update your <strong>Product Catalog</strong> and ensure that your listings meet Walmart's requirements.
