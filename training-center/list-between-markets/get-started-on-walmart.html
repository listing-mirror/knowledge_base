    <h2>Learn how to use the data from your other market listings to create new Walmart listings, avoiding common pitfalls</h2>
        <p>
            To successfully begin your Walmart journey, it is crucial that your product information meets Walmart's requirements.
            Our comprehensive guide will instruct you on the essential information you need, where to find it, and the most efficient method of entering data.
        </p>
    <h3>Common Pitfall: Missing UPC, GTIN, EAN, or ISBN</h3>
        <p>
            To comply with Walmart's requirements, it is essential that your listings include a <strong>Product Identifier</strong>.
            If any of the marketplaces you have integrated with us have provided this information, it should already be in your <strong>Product Catalog</strong>.
            However, if it is missing, you will need to find the product identifier from another source.

        <p>
            Once you have gathered all the required information, it is important to proceed with updating your <strong>Product Catalog</strong> to ensure that your listings align with Walmart's requirements.

    <h3>Common Pitfall: Missing shipping weight and unit of measurement</h3>
        <p>
            To comply with Walmart's requirements, it is essential to provide the shipping weight and its unit of measurement for all listings.
            If this information is already available in your Product Catalog from any integrated marketplace, you are all set.
            However, if it is missing, you will need to manually enter the data.
