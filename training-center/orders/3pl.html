        <p>
            When your customers place orders using your third-party logistics (3PL) inventory, we'll send those orders to the appropriate place.
            The 3PL will fill the order, give us the tracking number, and we'll notify the marketplace that the order has shipped.

    <h2>Autofill MCF, DLV, and RSL orders</h2>
        <p>
            If you want to avoid sending orders manually to Amazon, Deliverr, or ShipWorks you can enable <strong>Autofill MCF / DLV / RSL Orders</strong> on an integration basis.
            "MCF" is short for <strong>Multi-Channel Fulfillment</strong>, "DLV" is short for <strong>Deliverr</strong>, and "RSL" is short for <strong>ShipWorks</strong>.

    <h2>Handling Amazon MCF returns</h2>
        <p>
            To manage an MCF return via Amazon, you'll need to create a custom return.

        </p>
