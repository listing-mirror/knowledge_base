            We provide straightforward pricing, electing not to take a cut of your sales, or lock you into a contract.
            Our monthly or yearly subscriptions allow you to use the service at your leisure with no long-term commitment.

    <h3>Subscription plans, and your first 30 days</h3>
        <p>
            We understand that every business has unique needs.
            That's why our plans are tailored to provide you with the features you require, without forcing you to pay for anything unnecessary.
            We want you to get the most out of our software, which is why we offer a complimentary onboarding process during your first 30 days.
            If you decide that Listing Mirror isn't the right fit for your business, we offer a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee</strong> to ensure your satisfaction.
