    <h3>Learn more about Listing Mirror, and how we work to provide value to your business</h3>
        <p>
            We partner with your business to increase sales, and streamline listing management, inventory syncing, and order fulfillment.
            We pride ourselves on the ability to customize our software for all types of users, no matter the size!
            Listing Mirror does more than help you create your products on other market. 
            We have three pillars to our software, all working together for you.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Pillar One: Listing Management</h2>
        <p>
            First, we'll import your listings when you add a marketplace for the first time.
            We'll use this data to build a <strong>Product Catalog</strong>. 
            This will house all your listing data, such as titles, descriptions, images, price, and more.
            Building this <strong>Product Catalog</strong> allows you to create your products for new markets, using the existing data.

        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Pillar Two: Inventory Syncing</h2>
        <p>
            Then, we'll begin syncing your inventory levels between channels.
            If a customer buys something on one market, we'll let other markets know you have less inventory.
            You'll update your inventory levels directly on Listing Mirror to avoid going to each market individually to update them.

        </p>
        <p>
            You'll have the ability to disable this feature, should you use another software. 
            However, we've found it crucial to ensure that you don't oversell, and allow our tools, such as inventory history, forecasting, and low stock alerts to function.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Pillar Three: Order Management</h2>
        <p>
            Finally, each marketplace will send your orders to us, where you can then view, fill, and manage your them, including Fulfilled By Amazon (FBA).
            If you're using multiple channels already, you'll understand how frustrating it is to log onto each marketplace to manage your orders.
