    <h3>Learn how Listing Mirror's billing works, and how to manage your subscription</h3>
        <p>
            We provide straightforward pricing, electing not to take a cut of your sales, or lock you into a contract.
            Our monthly or yearly subscriptions allow you to use the service at your leisure with no long-term commitment.
        </p>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <h3>Plans</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.listingmirror.com/price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our plans</a> are based around the orders your business generates.
            Orders from all connected channels, aside from <strong>Fulfilled By Amazon</strong>, and <strong>Walmart Fulfillment Service</strong> will count towards your monthly limit.
            When you exceed your monthly limit, you'll be upgraded to the next tier at a prorated cost, only charging you for what you'll use until your next billing cycle, not the entire month.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note, if you're on a yearly plan, we'll continue to calculate monthly orders.
        </p>
    <h3>Pre-Trial & Trial</h3>
        <p>
            Once you sign up, you have indefinite time to add your integrations, and manage your account without making changes to the market.
            The banner at the top of the <a href="https://reflector.listingmirror.com/app/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dashboard</a> will indicate you're in your pre-trial.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you're ready, click <strong>Start Syncing</strong>, which will start your 14-day free trial, and start sending data to the market.

    <h2>Manage Subscription</h2>
        <p>
            Before getting started, ensure you're <a href="https://reflector.listingmirror.com/app/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logged into the correct account</a>.
            Verify you're on the correct account by going to your <a href="https://reflector.listingmirror.com/app/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dashboard</a>, and checking the <strong>Business ID</strong> at the top right of your screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            To access the <a href="https://reflector.listingmirror.com/app/profile/billing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billing page</a>, click your <strong>Business ID</strong>, followed by <strong>Billing Information</strong>.
        </p>
    <h3>Plan Level</h3>
        <p>
            The first thing you'll see is your plan level, along with your order count.
            If you're on the monthly plan, you can upgrade to the yearly plan to save.
            Regardless of plan, you can cancel at any time.
        </p>

    <h3>Billing Information & Invoice</h3>
        <p>
            Below your plan level, you can find your payment information, and invoices.
            The payment details input will be used to pay your current, or next payment.
        </p>
        <p>
            To see all past and current payments, review your invoices.
            You can download a PDF of your invoice to view further details.
            If an invoice is missing a checkmark, the invoice has yet to be paid, and your syncing status may be disabled.
        </p>

    <h3>Agency</h3>
        <p>
            If you belong to an agency, and have multiple accounts, we will indicate which is the main billing account.
            Should you have permission, you can quickly switch to that account to view billing information.
            If not, you'll be denied access.
