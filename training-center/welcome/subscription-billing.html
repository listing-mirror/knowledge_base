    <h3>How to manage your subscription</h3>
        <p>
            Before getting started, ensure you're <a href="https://reflector.listingmirror.com/app/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logged into the correct account</a>.
            Verify you're on the correct account by going to your <a href="https://reflector.listingmirror.com/app/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dashboard</a>, and checking the <strong>Business ID</strong> at the top right of your screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            To access the <a href="https://reflector.listingmirror.com/app/profile/billing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billing page</a>, click your <strong>Business ID</strong>, followed by <strong>Billing Information</strong>.
        </p>
    <h4>Plan Level</h4>
        <p>
            The first thing you'll see is your plan level.
            If you're on the monthly plan, you can upgrade to the yearly plan to save.
            Regardless of plan, you can cancel at any time by clicking <strong>Cancel Subscription</strong> at the top right.
        </p>

    <h4>Billing Information & Invoice</h4>
        <p>
            Below your plan level, you can find your payment information, and invoices.
            The payment details input will be used to pay your current, or next payment.
        </p>
        <p>
            To see all past and current payments, review your invoices.
            You can download a PDF of your invoice to view further details.
            If an invoice is missing a checkmark, the invoice has yet to be paid, and your syncing status may be disabled.
        </p>

    <h4>Agency</h4>
        <p>
            If you belong to an agency, and have multiple accounts, we will indicate which is the main billing account.
            Should you have permission, you can quickly switch to that account to view billing information.
            If not, you'll be denied access.
