    <h3>Learn how Fulfilled By Amazon, Walmart Fulfillment Services, and other third-party logistics inventory operate on Listing Mirror</h3>
        <p>
            We have limited control over your third-party inventory sources.
            Instead, these sources send us inventory levels, allowing us to fill orders with them.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Fulfilled By Amazon</h2>
        <p>
            Adding your Amazon account will give us hourly updates on your FBA inventory, allowing us access to your inventory levels.
            You can then sell this inventory on other platforms using Amazon's <strong>Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF)</strong>.

        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Walmart Fulfillment Services</h2>
        <p>
            Adding your Walmart account will give us hourly updates on your WFS inventory, allowing us to view your inventory levels.
            At the moment, WFS is limited to Walmart only, so you'll be unable to sell items in your Walmart warehouse on other platforms.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Deliverr</h2>
        <p>
            Adding Deliverr will allow you to manage your inventory on their platform, and allow us to send that inventory to any marketplace.
            Our knowledge base explains how to connect with Deliverr.

        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, when a customer places an order using Deliverr quantity, we'll use the items in the Deliverr warehouse to fill the order.

    <h2>SkuVault</h2>
    <p>
        Adding SkuVault will allow you to manage your inventory on their platform, and allow us to send that inventory to any marketplace.
        If you're already using SkuVault, we encourage you to add your connection to Listing Mirror for better clarity on your inventory.

    <h2>ShipWorks</h2>
        <p>
            I don't know anything about this platform, so I don't know what will go here, nor do I know anyone who's using it to investigate.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>API & FTP</h2>
        <p>
            We offer both File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Application Programming Interface (API) inventory updates.
            If you have an advanced inventory system, or use a platform that we don't integrate with, either of these would be the solution.
            You can learn more about setting up these connections in our knowledge base.
