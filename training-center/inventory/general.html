    <h2>Enable & Disable Inventory</h2>

            On this page, you can also sort which inventory sources you want to sell first.
            Drag which inventory sources you'd like enabled or disabled to the approiate box.
            Depending on the sort order, we'll attempt to sell that inventory first.
            You should order them from most important to least important.
