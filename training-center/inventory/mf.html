    <h3>Learn how to view, manage, and edit inventory for your businesses warehouse</h3>
        <p>
            Since we'll be managing your inventory, you'll be expected to update your levels appropriately.
            We provide a wide array of tools, including: an inventory overview page, bulk update spreadsheets, API or FTP connections, and more.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Inventory Source</h2>
        <p>
            We assign everyone a default merchant fulfilled inventory source when you sign up.
            When we import your listings, we also import your inventory levels, and assign them to this source.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note, we'll keep the merchant fulfilled inventory of the first integration added.
            If you add Amazon with 10 quantity first, then eBay with 15, we'll keep 10. If you add another market in the future, we won't update your merchant fulfilled inventory.
            Instead, we'll update this new market with your current inventory.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Before you start syncing, it's important you verify your merchant fulfilled quantity is correct</strong>.
        </p>
    <h3>Add Inventory Source</h3>
        <p>
            If you have more than one warehouse, you'll want to set up multiple inventory sources.
        </p>

            <li>Click <strong>Add New Inventory Source</strong>.</li>
            <li>Fill out all required details.</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Orders & Cancelled Orders</h2>
    <h3>Received Orders</h3>
        <p>
            After your customer pays for your product, and the order is imported into Listing Mirror, we'll subtract the quantity purchased.
            Once subtracted, we'll inform other connected markets of the change, properly reflecting the new inventory level.
        </p>
    <h3>Cancelled Orders</h3>
        <p>
            When an order is cancelled, what happens to the quantity will depend on where the order is cancelled.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Listing Mirror: We'll provide you the option to return the quantity or not.</li>
            <li>The Market: Regardless if done by you, or the customer, the quantity <strong>will</strong> be returned.</li>
            <li>Past 14 Days: Regardless of location, the quantity <strong>will not</strong> be returned.</li>
        </ul>
