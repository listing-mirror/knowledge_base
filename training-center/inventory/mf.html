    <h3>Learn how to view, manage, and edit inventory for your businesses warehouse on Listing Mirror</h3>
        <p>
            Once you've started syncing, you'll be expected to update your levels appropriately on our platform.
            We provide a wide array of tools, including an inventory overview page, bulk update spreadsheets, API or FTP connections, and more.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Manage and add inventory sources</h2>
        <p>
            We assign everyone a default merchant fulfilled inventory source when you sign up.
            When we import your listings, we also import your inventory levels, and assign them to this source.
        </p>
    <div class="LM-Info">
        <p>
            We'll keep the merchant fulfilled inventory of the first integration added.
            If you add integrations in the future, we won't overwrite your imported inventory on that market.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="LM-Error">
        <p>
            <strong>Before you start syncing, it's important you verify your merchant fulfilled quantity is correct</strong>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Add Inventory Source</h3>

    <h2>Inventory affected by sales or cancelled orders</h2>
    <h3>Received Orders</h3>
        <p>
            After your customer pays for your product, and the order is imported into Listing Mirror, we'll subtract the quantity purchased.
            Once subtracted, we'll inform other connected markets of the change, properly reflecting the new inventory level.
        </p>
    <h3>Cancelled Orders</h3>
        <p>
            When an order is cancelled, what happens to the quantity will depend on where the order is cancelled.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Listing Mirror: We'll provide you the option to return the quantity or not.</li>
            <li>The Market: Regardless if done by you, or the customer, the quantity <strong>will</strong> be returned.</li>
            <li>Past 14 Days: Regardless of location, the quantity <strong>will not</strong> be returned.</li>
        </ul>
