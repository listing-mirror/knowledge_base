    <h2>Learn how Fulfilled By Amazon, Walmart Fulfillment Services, and other third-party logistics operate on Listing Mirror</h2>
        <p>
            We have limited control over your third-party inventory sources.
            Instead, these sources send us inventory levels, allowing us to fill orders with them.
        </p>

    <h3>Fulfilled By Amazon (FBA)</h3>
        <p>
            Adding your Amazon account will give us hourly updates on your FBA inventory, allowing us access to your inventory levels.
            You can then sell this inventory on other platforms using Amazon's <strong>Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF)</strong>.

        </p>

    <h3>Walmart Fulfillment Services (WFS)</h3>
        <p>
            Adding your Walmart account will give us hourly updates on your WFS inventory, allowing us to view your inventory levels.
            Currently, WFS is limited to Walmart only, so you'll be unable to sell items in your Walmart warehouse on other platforms.
        </p>

    <h3>Deliverr</h3>
        <p>
            Adding Deliverr allows you to manage your inventory on their platform, and allows us to send that inventory to any marketplace.
            Our knowledge base explains how to connect with Deliverr.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, when a customer places an order using Deliverr quantity, Deliverr will fill the order, and ship the item from their warehouse.

    <h3>SkuVault</h3>
    <p>
        Adding SkuVault will allow you to manage your inventory on their platform, and allow us to send that inventory to any marketplace.
        If you're already using SkuVault, we encourage you to add your connection, as we sync your inventory immediately, rather than at specific intervals.
        It also allows us to provide you with inventory-based tools, such as forecasting, inventory history, low stock alerts, and more.

    <h3>Flowspace (Coming soon!)</h3>
    <h3>API & FTP</h3>
        <p>
            We offer both File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Application Programming Interface (API) inventory updates.
            If you have an advanced inventory system, or use a platform that we don't integrate with, either of these would be the solution.
            You can learn more about setting up these connections in our knowledge base.

            Finally, we'll wrap up by talking about your orders, and how inventory interacts with them.
