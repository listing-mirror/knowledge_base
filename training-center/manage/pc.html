    <h2>Learn how to edit your product data across multiple markets at once using Listing Mirror's Product Catalog</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Product Catalog</strong> allows you to manage your listings details all in one place.
            You'll be able to edit details that are similar between markets, such as titles, descriptions, images, price, and more.
            Having your listings connected to the same <strong>Product Catalog</strong> also allows us to keep your inventory in sync across each marketplace.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do you need to create a <strong>Product Catalog</strong> from scratch?

        </p>

    <h3>Manage your listing details</h3>
        <p>
            The required fields are title, SKU, and price.
            Other fields will fill in the gaps that other marketplaces require, and make sure your customers have detailed information.
            To edit any field, click on the text box, and input the data.
        </p>
    <h4>Fields In Sync</h4>
        <p>
            Below each field, you'll see a green or yellow box, indicating which markets are in sync.
            Clicking the box will provide you with one of three options, depending on the marketplace.
                <ul>
                    <li>In Sync - In sync with the marketplace listing.</li>
                    <li>Out of Sync - Out of sync with the marketplace listing.</li>
                    <li>Excluded - Field does not exist on the marketplace.</li>
                </ul>
            If something is out of sync, you can select the checkbox next to the market, followed by <strong>Sync Selected</strong>.
            This will remove the market listing data and replace it with <strong>Product Catalog</strong> data.
        </p>
    <h4>Description & Bullet Points</h4>
        <p>
            In cases where a market does not support bullet points and your description is in sync with the <strong>Product Catalog</strong>, we will display your bullet points in the description.
            This feature exists for BigCommerce, Etsy, eBay, Shopify, Magento, Overstock, Google Shopping, and Wish.
        </p>
    <h4>Identifiers</h4>
        <p>
            Some markets require a product identifier.
            By default, we show ASIN, UPC, and MPN.
            To add other types, click <strong>Add</strong>, and select an option.
            We support ASIN, UPC, GTIN, EAN, ISBN, and MPN.
        </p>
    <h4>Category</h4>
        <p>
            The <strong>Product Catalog</strong> will display categories based on Amazon, even if you don't use Amazon.
            You can assign these to your products, and we'll use your <strong>Category Mapping</strong> to assign marketplace categories.
            <a href="../crosspost/category-mapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more</a>
        </p>
    <h4>Price</h4>
        <p>
            Regardless of which region you're syncing to, the price on the <strong>Product Catalog</strong> will always be in USD.
            If the price field is in sync with the <strong>Product Catalog</strong>, we will convert the price from USD to the region of choice using global market data.
        </p>

    <h3>Manage your listing details in bulk</h3>
    <h4>Update From Amazon</h4>
        <p>
            If you're an Amazon-first seller, you may want to update your listing details based on the Amazon listing data.
            Regardless of ASIN ownership, you can pull the description, images, bullet points, and title from Amazon to update these fields.
            From the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown, click <strong>Update From Amazon</strong>, and select which fields to update.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the <strong>Manage Listings</strong> page, select a <strong>Product Catalog</strong>.</li>
            <li>On the <strong>Actions</strong> menu, click <strong>Update From Amazon</strong>.</li>
            <li>Select the fields you want to update, and click <strong>Update</strong>.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            This feature is not automatic, and needs to be manually triggered.
            If there are variations, each variation will need an ASIN in the <strong>Identifiers</strong> field.

    <h3>Create your market listings</h3>
        <p>
            When the data you input is satisfactory, it's time to create the listings on the market.
            On the right side, in the <strong>Market Listings</strong> box, click the plus button for each marketplace you'd like to add listings to.
            If the market requires a category, we'll ask you to select one, and put any addition data the market requires.
        </p>
    <h4>Market Listing Status</h4>

            <li><strong>Check Mark</strong>: Your listing is live and in sync.</li>
            <li><strong>Flame</strong>: Your listing is incomplete, or has an error.</li>
            <li><strong>Warning (merge)</strong>: Your product variations are not grouped on the marketplace, and exist as multiple variations</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clicking <strong>Merge</strong> will delete your marketplace listings, and create them under the product variation.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Plus</strong>: No market listing exists.</li>
            <li><strong>Plus (x / y created)</strong>: You've created a certain number out of the total possible variations able to be created.</li>
            <li><strong>Information</strong>: Your listing is pending creation after adding an offer.</li>
        </ul>
