    <h3>Learn how to edit individual market listings based on the marketplace</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Market Listing</strong> is the home of your marketplace-specific listing.
            Here, you can view unique information, input marketplace-specific data, and review any errors, warnings, and incomplete messages.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Listing</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Listing</strong> tab is where you'll update your primary listing details.
            Since each marketplace is different, they may have unique fields.
            It's important to remember that the <strong>Product Catalog</strong> contains general information, but will lack marketplace-specific data.
            Examples include eBay's business policies, Etsy's shipping profile, or Walmart's <em>Prop 65</em> warning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any field under <strong>Parent Listing Fields</strong> will update across all variations, while <strong>Child Listing Fields</strong> are unique to the listing.
            An example of a <strong>Parent Listing Field</strong> would be <strong>Variation Names</strong>, while a <strong>Child Listing Field</strong> would be a SKU, or price.
        </p>
    <h2>Category</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Category</strong> tab allows you to set the category, and the category-specific information for your listing.
            Every marketplace doesn't have traditional categories, so this tab may be missing from certain marketplace listings.
            Some examples include Shopify and Wish.
        </p>
        <p>
            After selecting your category, you may need to fill out additional information.
            Below the category selector, you'll see data fields, where you can input information.
            All required fields will be marked with a red asterisks.
        </p>
    <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Images</strong> tab allows you to set unique marketplace images.
            If you elect to use this tab, the images will no longer be sourced from the <strong>Product Catalog</strong>.
            Upload your images, and sort them in the order you want them to appear on the marketplace.
            For variations, you'll want to assign all images to a single listing, then use the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown to navigate to the <strong>Edit Variation Images</strong> page.
        </p>
        <p>
            To go back to using the <strong>Product Catalog</strong> for your images, click the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown, followed by <strong>Sync PC Images</strong>.
