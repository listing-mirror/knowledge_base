    <h3>Learn how to edit individual market listings based on the marketplace</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Market Listing</strong> is the home of your marketplace-specific listing.
            Here, you can view unique information, input marketplace-specific data, and review any errors, warnings, and incomplete messages.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Manage Data</h2>
    <h3>Listing</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Listing</strong> tab is where you'll update your primary listing details.
            Since each marketplace is different, they may have unique fields.
            It's important to remember that the <strong>Product Catalog</strong> contains general information, but will lack marketplace-specific data.
            Examples include eBay's business policies, Etsy's shipping profile, or Walmart's <em>Prop 65</em> warning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any field under <strong>Parent Listing Fields</strong> will update across all variations, while <strong>Child Listing Fields</strong> are unique to the listing.
            An example of a <strong>Parent Listing Field</strong> would be <strong>Variation Names</strong>, while a <strong>Child Listing Field</strong> would be a SKU, or price.
        </p>
    <h3>Category</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Category</strong> tab allows you to set the category, and the category-specific information for your listing.
            Every marketplace doesn't have traditional categories, so this tab may be missing from certain marketplace listings.
            Some examples include Shopify and Wish.
        </p>
        <p>
            After selecting your category, you may need to fill out additional information.
            Below the category selector, you'll see data fields, where you can input information.
            All required fields will be marked with a red asterisks.
        </p>
    <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Images</strong> tab allows you to set unique marketplace images.
            If you elect to use this tab, the images will no longer be sourced from the <strong>Product Catalog</strong>.
            Upload your images, and sort them in the order you want them to appear on the marketplace.
            For variations, you'll want to assign all images to a single listing, then use the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown to navigate to the <strong>Edit Variation Images</strong> page.
        </p>
        <p>
            To go back to using the <strong>Product Catalog</strong> for your images, click the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown, followed by <strong>Sync PC Images</strong>.
        </p>
    <h3>Variations</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Variations</strong> tab shows all your child information.
            This includes based information, such as title, SKU, price, and variation values, but all child fields as well.
            Clicking the <strong>Bulk Edit Field</strong> dropdown allows you to change all child information in bulk. 
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Bulk Changes</h2>
        <p>
            We offer a variety of templates that let you change information on each of these tabs.
        </p>
    <h3>Listing</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Market Listing Core Edit</strong> template allows you to edit any information on the <strong>Listing</strong> tab, as well as what category the listing is in.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Listings</strong>, followed by <strong>Bulk Edit Templates</strong>.</li>
            <li>Using the dropdown, select <strong>Market Listing Core Edit</strong> and the desired integration, followed by <strong>Download Template</strong>.</li>
            <li>Open the sheet and input all desired information.</li>
            <li>Save changes, head back to <strong>Bulk Edit Templates</strong>, and click <strong>Upload Template</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Category</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Category Specific Add/Update</strong> template allows you to edit any information on the <strong>Category</strong> tab.
            Not all markets have categories, so you can only use this for those that do.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Listings</strong>, followed by <strong>Bulk Edit Templates</strong>.</li>
            <li>Using the dropdown, select <strong>Category Specific Add/Update</strong> and the desired integration, followed by <strong>Download Template</strong>.</li>
            <li>Open the sheet and input all desired information.</li>
            <li>Save changes, head back to <strong>Bulk Edit Templates</strong>, and click <strong>Upload Template</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If you need less information, and just want to fix errors, you can use the <strong>Missing Category Specific</strong> template, or the <strong>Repair Incomplete Listings</strong> page.

        </p>
    <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Image Edit</strong> template allows you to edit any information on the <strong>Image</strong> tab.
            Adding images here will remove the sync between the <strong>Product Catalog</strong> and the <strong>Market Listing</strong>.
            If you want your images to be in sync, consider using the <strong>Product Edit</strong> template.
