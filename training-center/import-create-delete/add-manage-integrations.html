            An integration or channel is defined as any connection made to our platform.
            A list of integrations can be found on our website.

            <li>On the top right, click <strong>Connect A New Integration</strong>.</li>

            If you don't see an advertised integration, or states, “Reach out to support”, or “Please upgrade your subscription”,
            <a href="../welcome/contact-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact support</a> with the integration you'd like to add.
        </p>
    <h3>How to manage your existing integration</h3>
        <p>
            You can view your integrations on the
            <a href="https://reflector.listingmirror.com/app/integrations/manage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Integrations</a> page.
        </p>
    <h4>Enable & Disable Integrations</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Integrations</strong>, followed by <strong>Manage Integrations</strong>.</li>
            <li>Select your desired integration.</li>
            <li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, enable or disable your integration, and save changes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            When an integration is disabled, syncing to the marketplace will cease.
            In the event of a lost connection, we will promptly notify you via email and disable the integration.       
        </p>
    <h4>Delete Integrations</h4>
        <p>
            It is important to note that only a disabled integration can be deleted.
            Please refrain from deleting an integration as a troubleshooting step, as it may cause further issues.
            Instead, we recommend refreshing your credentials if you are experiencing any problems with your integration.
