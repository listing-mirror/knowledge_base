            It's important to note that we currently only support automatic import for Amazon and WooCommerce listings.
            Any listings from other markets will need to be manually created on our platform.
            We are unable to manage any listings created outside our platform.
        </p>
    <h3>Create listings on a specific marketplace</h3>
        <p>
            If you're new to our platform and need to list data from another channel,
            <a href="../list-between-markets/map-amazon-categories-to-other-markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our listing guide</a> can help.
            Creating a market listing with our various methods requires data from your Product Catalog, which can be filled out by you when creating a new product or during the initial import process.
