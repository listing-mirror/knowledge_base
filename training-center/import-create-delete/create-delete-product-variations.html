            It's important to note that we currently only support automatic import for Amazon and WooCommerce listings.
            Any listings from other markets will need to be manually created on our platform.
            We are unable to manage any listings created outside our platform.

    <h3>Delete a product variation that's no longer needed</h3>
        <p>
            If you're trying to delete a listing, you don't need to delete the product.
            A product can exist with no consequence, even if no market listing is associated with it.
        </p>
        <h4>Individual Products</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>From the <strong>Manage Listings</strong> page, search for a desired SKU, and click the product title.</li>
                <li>In the <strong>Variations</strong> box, click the delete button.</li>
                <li>Save changes.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="LM-Info">
                <p>
                    This will only delete the product. You'll still have to delete the market listing.
