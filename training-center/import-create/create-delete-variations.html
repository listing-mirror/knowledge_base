    <h2>Learn how to create and delete your existing products variations on Listing Mirror</h2>
        <p>
            We don't automatically import listings from any market aside from Amazon and WooCommerce after you've added the integration.
            New products or listings need to be created using our software, as we cannot manage anything off platform.
        </p>
    <h3>Create product variations for existing products</h3>
        <h4>Individual Listings</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>On a <strong>product</strong> page, click the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown, followed by <strong>Add Variation</strong>.</li>
                <li>Input any required details, and click <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Multiple Listings</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Listings</strong>, followed by <strong>Bulk Edit Templates</strong>.</li>
                <li>Using the dropdown, select <strong>Product Add</strong>, followed by <strong>Download Template</strong>.</li>
                <li>Open the spreadsheet (.xlsx), and input all the desired information.</li>

            </ol>
            <p>
                To create variations, start by filling out the parent fields in column A to AC.
                Then, fill out the child fields AD to CC.
                Parent details only need to be filled out once.
                For each variation, only fill out the child information.

    <h3>Delete a product variation that's no longer needed</h3>
        <p>
            If you're trying to delete a listing, you don't need to delete the product.
            A product can exist with no consequence, even if no market listing is associated with it.
        </p>
        <h4>Individual Products</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>From the <strong>Manage Listings</strong> page, search for a desired SKU, and click the product title.</li>
                <li>In the <strong>Variations</strong> box, click the delete button.</li>
                <li>Save changes.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="LM-Info">
                <p>
                    This will only delete the product. You'll still have to delete the market listing.
