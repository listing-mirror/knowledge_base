    <h2>Learn how to create and delete your listings once your product data has been filled out on Listing Mirror</h2>
        <p>
            We don't automatically import listings from any market aside from Amazon and WooCommerce after you've added the integration.
            New products or listings need to be created using our software, as we cannot manage anything off platform.
        </p>
    <h3>Create listings on a specific marketplace</h3>
        <p>
            Creating a listing using our various methods will use the data from your <strong>Product Catalog</strong>.
            That data is either filled out by you when creating a new product or during the initial import process.
            If you're getting started with us, and want to learn how to list data from another channel, continue to our
