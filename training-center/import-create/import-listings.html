    <h2>Learn how Listing Mirror imports your listings after you connect your marketplace integration</h2>
        <p>
            When you add a marketplace for the first time, we'll import any listings you have on the market, should they meet the import requirements.
            If you resolve the issue after adding your marketplace, reach out to support for a one-time manual import.
        </p>

    <h3>Import Your Products</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Amazon</strong>: Products must be <strong>active</strong>, and have <strong>quantity</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>BigCommerce</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>, and not be a part of an existing variation in Listing Mirror.</li>
            <li><strong>eBay</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>, and not be a part of an existing variation in Listing Mirror.</li>
            <li><strong>Etsy</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>, and not be a part of an existing variation in Listing Mirror.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Shopping</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Newegg</strong>: Products must be <strong>active</strong>, and have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Reverb</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Shopify</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Walmart & Walmart CA</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique product identifier</strong>, such as a UPC, ISBN, EAN, or GTIN</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Walmart Canada</strong> has temporarily disabled ALL product imports.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Wish</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>WooCommerce</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>, and not be a part of an existing variation in Listing Mirror.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We'll continue to import new products from <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>WooCommerce</strong> every two hours.
            <strong>For other marketplaces, you'll be expected to create new products on Listing Mirror</strong>.
        </p>
    <h4>If your SKUs match across each market</h4>
        <p>
            When your SKUs match across each marketplace you're connecting, they'll be linked together under the same product.
            This enables us to sync the inventory between each item on each market.
        </p>
        <p>
            Should your SKUs not match, you'll need to link your listings together to a similar product.
        </p>
    <h4>If your product variations import as single products</h4>
        <p>
            Rarely, a marketplace will break up your variations into separate products.
            Should this happen, you'll need to merge your product together, bringing the variations back together under one parent product.
        </p>

        <h3>Overstock</h3>
        <p>
            We're unable to import Overstock listings.
            You'll have to run a manual export on Overstock, and present that data to us.
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>On <strong>Overstock</strong>, go to your <a href="https://edge.supplieroasis.com/product/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Products</a> tab.</li>
                <li>From the <strong>Export</strong> dropdown, click <strong>Full Catalog</strong>.</li>
                <li>Ensure <strong>Full Template</strong> and <strong>Horizontal</strong>.</li>
                <li>Contact support with your spreadsheet, and ask for Overstock products to be imported.</li>
            </ol>

    <h3>Walmart & Newegg</h3>
        <p>
            Walmart and Newegg provide third-parties with incomplete data.
            During the import process, some information is not provided to us.

            Since we control your listing data, we combat potential data loss by making these products <strong>ineligible for edits</strong> until you consent.
