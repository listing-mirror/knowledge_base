    <h3>Learn how Listing Mirror imports your listings after you connect your marketplace integration</h3>
        <p>
            When you connect a marketplace for the first time, we'll import any listings you have on the market, should they meet the import requirements.
            If you resolve the issue after adding your marketplace, reach out to support for a one-time manual import.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Import Your Products</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Amazon</strong>: Products must be <strong>active</strong>, and have <strong>quantity</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>BigCommerce</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>, and not be a part of an existing variation in Listing Mirror.</li>
            <li><strong>eBay</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>, and not be a part of an existing variation in Listing Mirror.</li>
            <li><strong>Etsy</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>, and not be a part of an existing variation in Listing Mirror.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Shopping</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Newegg</strong>: Products must be <strong>active</strong>, and have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Reverb</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Shopify</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Walmart & Walmart CA</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique product identifier</strong>, such as a UPC, ISBN, EAN, or GTIN</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Please note, <strong>Walmart Canada</strong> has temporarily disabled ALL product imports.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Wish</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>WooCommerce</strong>: Products must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>, and not be a part of an existing variation in Listing Mirror.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once imported, we'll continue to import new products from <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>WooCommerce</strong> every two hours.
            For other marketplaces, no other imports will be run.
            <strong>You'll be expected to create new products on Listing Mirror</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your SKUs are matching across all marketplaces, they'll be linked together on the <strong>Product Catalog</strong>.
            If your SKUs differ, you'll need to link them together.

        </p>
        <p>
            If two or more SKUs are part of the same parent, but came separated, you'll need to merge them together.

    <h2>Overstock</h2>
        <p>
            We cannot import Overstock products.
            You'll have to run a manual export on Overstock, and present that data to us.
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>On <strong>Overstock</strong>, go to your <a href="https://edge.supplieroasis.com/product/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Products</a> tab.</li>
                <li>From the <strong>Export</strong> dropdown, click <strong>Full Catalog</strong>.</li>
                <li>Ensure <strong>Full Template</strong> and <strong>Horizontal</strong>.</li>
                <li><a href="../welcome/contact-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact support</a> with your sheet, and ask for Overstock products to be imported.</li>
            </ol>

    <h2>Walmart & Newegg</h2>
        <p>
            These markets provide third-parties with incomplete data. When imported, some information may be missed.
            Since Listing Mirror controls your listing data, we combat potential data loss by making these products <strong>not editable</strong> until you consent.
