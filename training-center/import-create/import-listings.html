    <h2>Learn how Listing Mirror imports your listings after you connect your marketplace integration</h2>
        <p>
            When you add a marketplace for the first time, we'll import any listings you have on the marketplace, should they meet the import requirements.
            Once a listing is imported, we then use that data to build a <strong>Product Catalog</strong>.
            <a href="../manage/pc">Learn more</a>
        </p>
    <h3>Criteria for your listings to be imported</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Amazon</strong>: Listings must be <strong>active</strong>, and have <strong>quantity</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>BigCommerce</strong>: Listings must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>, and not be a part of an existing variation in Listing Mirror.</li>
            <li><strong>eBay</strong>: Listings must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>, and not be a part of an existing variation in Listing Mirror.</li>
            <li><strong>Etsy</strong>: Listings must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>, and not be a part of an existing variation in Listing Mirror.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Shopping</strong>: Listings must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Newegg</strong>: Listings must be <strong>active</strong>, and have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Reverb</strong>: Listings must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Shopify</strong>: Listings must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Walmart</strong>: Listings must have a <strong>unique product identifier</strong>, such as a UPC, ISBN, EAN, or GTIN</li>
            <li><strong>Wish</strong>: Listings must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>WooCommerce</strong>: Listings must have a <strong>unique SKU</strong>, and not be a part of an existing variation in Listing Mirror.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We'll continue to import new listings from <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>WooCommerce</strong> every two hours.
            <strong>For other marketplaces, you'll be expected to create new listings on Listing Mirror</strong>.
        </p>
    <h4>If you have mismatched SKUs across each marketplace</h4>
        <p>
            When your SKUs match across each marketplace you're connecting, they'll be linked together under the same <strong>Product Catalog</strong>.
            This enables us to sync the inventory between each item on each market.
            Should your SKUs not match, you'll need to link your listings together to the corresponding product.
        </p>
    <h4>If your product variations imported as simple products</h4>
        <p>
            Rarely, a marketplace will break up your variations into separate products.
            Should this happen, you'll need to merge your product together, bringing the variations back together under one parent product.
        </p>
        <h3>Overstock</h3>
        <p>
            We're unable to import Overstock listings.
            You'll have to run a manual export on Overstock, and present that data to us.
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>On <strong>Overstock</strong>, go to your <a href="https://edge.supplieroasis.com/product/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Products</a> tab.</li>
                <li>From the <strong>Export</strong> dropdown, click <strong>Full Catalog</strong>.</li>
                <li>Ensure <strong>Full Template</strong> and <strong>Horizontal</strong>.</li>
                <li>Contact support with your spreadsheet, and ask for Overstock listings to be imported.</li>
            </ol>
    <h3>Walmart & Newegg</h3>
        <p>
            Walmart and Newegg provide third-parties with incomplete data.
            During the import process, some information is not provided to us.
            Since we control your listing data, we combat potential data loss by making these listings <strong>ineligible for edits</strong> until you consent.
