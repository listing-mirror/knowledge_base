    <h3>Learn how to add and manage your integrations on Listing Mirror</h3>
        <p>
            An integration is defined as any connection made to our platform.
            A list of integrations can be found on our website.
            <a href="https://www.listingmirror.com/integrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more</a>
        </p>
    <h2>Add Integration</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Integrations</strong>, followed by <strong>Manage Integrations</strong>.</li>
            <li>On the top right, click <strong>Connect A New Integration</strong>.</li>
            <li>Search or select the desired integration.</li>
            <li>Follow all required steps.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            We'll ask you a few questions about regarding how this connection will work on our platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't see an advertised integration, or states, “Reach out to support”, or “Please upgrade your subscription”,
            <a href="https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach out to support</a> with the integration you'd like to add.
        </p>
    <h2>Manage Integration</h2>
        <p>
            You can view your integrations on the
            <a href="https://reflector.listingmirror.com/app/integrations/manage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Integrations</a> page.
        </p>
    <h3>Enable & Disable</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Integrations</strong>, followed by <strong>Manage Integrations</strong>.</li>
            <li>Select your desired integration.</li>
            <li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, enable or disable your integration, and save changes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            A disabled integration will stop all syncing to the marketplace.
            Aside from disabling manually, if we lose connection to an integration, it'll become disabled, and we'll email you as to why. 
        </p>
    <h3>Delete Integration</h3>
        <p>
            Only a disabled integration can be deleted.
            Deleting an integration is not a valid troubleshooting step.
            If you're having issues with your integration, start by refreshing your credentials.
