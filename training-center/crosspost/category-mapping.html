        <p>
            After an Amazon listing is created or imported, we'll map its assigned category to the most relevant category on another marketplace.
            You can change these at any point from the <strong>Category Mapping</strong> page.
            From the menu bar, click <strong>Listings</strong>, followed by your region of choice.

    <h3>Assign your default category mappings</h3>
        <p>
            If there's a category you want your listings assigned to, you can select a default for each marketplace.
            Any listings that doesn't have a specific mapping will be assigned this category.
