# Getting Started: Price Sync Options
### Learn how to manage the price of your items

We provide you with a few different options for manging your prices, whether that be in Listing Mirror, or on Amazon. Listing Mirror was designed as an Amazon-first platform, so some workflows may include separate settings.

## Product Catalogue

This option will allow you to manage your pricing using the Product Catalogue, only needing to make one change to update all of your in-sync listings. Using this option will put Listing Mirror in control of your price on all markets.

### Amazon Marketplace

1. From the menubar, click **Integrations**, followed by **Manage Integrations**. 
2. Select your Amazon marketplace.
3. In the **General** tab, enable **Price Sync To Market**.
    Ensure **Price Sync** and **Update Price** are disabled.
4. In the **Advanced** tab, disable **Price Sync Target**.
5. clear amazon price fields

If you have more than one Amazon integration, you'll need to repeat this for each integration.

### Non-Amazon Markets

1. From the menubar, click **Integrations**, followed by **Manage Integrations**. 
2. Select a non-Amazon marketplace. 
3. Disable **Price Sync Target**

Once all your settings are in place, you can then update your prices accordingly. We have individual, or bulk options. 

### Update Individual Prices

1. From the **Manage Listings** page, select a **Product Catalogue**.
2. In the **Price** field, input the price of your item. 
3. Click **Save**.

### Update Bulk Prices

1. From the menubar, click **Listings**, followed by **Bulk Edit Templates**.
2. Using the dropdown, select **Product Edit** template, then **Download**.
3. In the spreadsheet, update the **Price** column for the SKU you need to update.
4. After saving changes, return to the **Bulk Edit Templates** page, and click **Upload**.

## Amazon Seller Account

If you feel more comfortable using Amazon to update your prices, you can do so there. We'll attempt to import the new price every 15-minutes, then send it to the other marketplace channels. 

### Main Amazon Marketplace

At this time, you can only do this with one Amazon channel. If you have multiple, you need to select a main channel. 

1. From the menubar, click **Integrations**, followed by **Manage Integrations**. 
2. Select your Amazon marketplace.
3. In the **General** tab, enable **Update Price**, and **Price Sync**.
    Ensure **Price Sync To Market** is disabled.

For any non-Amazon channel you choose to leave **Price Sync Target** disabled, you'll need to update the prices on the **Market Listing** for each marketplace.

This option will allow you to individually manage the prices for your items based on marketplace. This is a great option for those who have different regional stores, and don't want your prices to update constantly with USD conversions.
