# Getting Started: Inventory
### Learn how to use the inventory-based features built into Listing Mirror 

Listing Mirror has great features that'll allow you to control how your inventory is sent to the market, as well as how you can view your inventory in unique ways.

## Setting Maximum Quantity

In certain situations, you may need to limit how much inventory is sent to a given marketplace. We have ways you can limit this for individual listings, and entire markets. 
Moving forward, we'll only send the market your desired inventory level until you change the limit. 

### Individual Listings

1. On the **Manage Listings** page, search for the SKU you need to limit.
2. Select the **Market Listing** for the given market you need to limit. 
3. From the **Listing** tab, scroll down to **Max Quantity** and set your number.

### Entire Market

1. On the menubar, click **Integrations**, followed by **Manage Integrations**.
2. Select a marketplace.
3. Select the **Inventory** tab.
4. In the **Max Quantity** tab, input a number. 

## Setting Holdback Quantity

In certain situations, you may need to reserve some of your inventory for other purposes. We have ways you can holdback a certain inventory level so it never goes to the market.
Moving forward, we'll reserve your desired amount from being sent to the market. Keep in mind, this will still say you're out of stock on that market, even though you have held back quantity. 

1. On the menubar, click **Integrations**, followed by **Manage Integrations**.
2. Select a marketplace.
3. Select the **Inventory** tab.
4. In the **Holdback Quantity** tab, input a number. 

## Reviewing Inventory History

It's important to know what happens to your inventory when something seems out of place. Using the inventory history page, you can review all inventory edits to a given SKU. 
This includes edits made by orders, bulk changes, or manual edits. We also include all FBA, WFS, and 3PL changes. 

1. On the menubar, click **Inventory**, followed by **Inventory History**. 
2. From the dropdown, input the title or SKU of the listing.
