# Getting Started: Merchant Fulfilled inventory
### Learn how to manage your personal inventory on Listing Mirror

Once you start syncing, Listing Mirror will manage your inventory across all of your markets. You'll be expected to manage your inventory levels on Listing Mirror, should you need to increase or decrease quantity manually. 

## Listing Inventory Source

When you first get started with Listing Mirror, and we import your listings, we'll also import your current inventory levels from the marketplace as well. We take the inventory from the first listing we import to prevent incorrect numbers. For example, if you have a product on Amazon and eBay, we'll take the inventory levels from whichever marketplace you integrate first.

If you decide to add another marketplace that has unique items in the future, we'll follow the same strategy. If it's new listing to Listing Mirror, we'll import the inventory level. If it exists already, and you didn't have that marketplace added, we'll use what you have currently, rather than overwriting your inventory. This will allow your inventory to remain uniform, even when integrating a new marketplace. 

## Updating Merchant Fulfilled Inventory

As mentioned before, Listing Mirror will manage your inventory. Therefore, it's important you understand how to make changes manually, should you obtain, move, or lose inventory. 

### Individual Listings
If you only have a few items to update, this is the most simple way to do so.

1. On the menubar, select **Inventory**, followed by **Manage Inventory**.
2. Using the search bar, search for the SKU you need to change.
3. In the **Quantity** field, change the number to reflect your current inventory levels.

## In Bulk
If you have a larger business, or need to make many changes, you'll want to use our **Quantity Update** template. 

1. On the menubar, select **Listings**, followed by **Bulk Edit Templates**.
2. From the dropdown, select **Quantity Update** template, followed by **Download Template**.
3. On the spreadsheet, you'll see your SKUs, along with the warehouses you have. Make the changes you need based on the inventory you have in each warehouse.
4. Head back to the **Bulk Edit Templates** page, and upload the sheet.

You can view the status of the spreadsheet in the [Bulk Upload History page](https://reflector.listingmirror.com/report/bulk-history/).

## Orders & Cancelling

As stated in [What Is Listing Mirror?](/training-centre/welcome/welcome), inventory syncing is one of our three pillars. We keep your inventory uniform across all platforms. 

### Orders

When a client places an order, the market will then tell Listing Mirror about the order. As soon as the market lets us know it's been paid for and accepted, we'll reduce your quantity. This allows us to tell the other connected markets that you now have less quantity. 
For example, if you're selling ten hats, and someone buys one on Amazon, we'll then tell your other markets that you now have nine hats left. This takes the work of manually adjusting your inventory on each marketplace individually. 

### Cancelling

When an order gets cancelled, what happens to the quantity will depend on where the order is cancelled. 
If you cancel an order through Listing Mirror, the quantity **will not** be returned. You'll need to adjust this manually.
If the order is cancelled on the market, either by you, or the customer, the quantity **will** be returned.
Should the order be cancelled 14 days after it's placed, the quantity **will not** be returned, regardless of where it's cancelled. 

Our section on orders will go into more detail on how to cancel orders, and process returns. [Learn more](/training-centre/orders/general)
