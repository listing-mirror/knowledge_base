    <h2>Learn how to use the Quantity Update spreadsheet to update inventory in your business warehouse</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Update Quantity</strong> spreadsheet enables users to easily update the quantity of items in their warehouse.
            These items are typically filled by the user's business and do not include any third-party logistics (3PL) services like Fulfilled By Amazon (FBA), Walmart Fulfillment Services (WFS), Deliverr, or similar providers.
            Since 3PLs cannot be modified, they will not be visible in the spreadsheet.
