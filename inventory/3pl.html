        <p>
            Listing Mirror has limited control over your third-party inventory sources.
            Instead, these sources send us inventory levels, allowing us to fill orders with them.
        </p>

    <h2>Multi-Channel Fulfillment</h2>
        <p>
            Using this third-party inventory, you can sell it on any platform.
            This is known as <strong>Multi-Channel Fulfillment</strong>.
            We provide you with the tools to sell each source on any market of your choosing.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Integrations</strong>, followed by <strong>Manage Integrations</strong>.</li>
            <li>Select a marketplace.</li>
            <li>From the <strong>Inventory</strong> tab, observe the green and red boxes.</li>
            <li>Adjust which source you'd like to use, in the order you'd like to use them.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The order of the inventory source will determine which inventory we sell first.
