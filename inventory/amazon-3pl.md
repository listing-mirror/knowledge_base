# Getting Started: Fulfilled By Amazon, and Third-Party Logistics
### Learn how your FBA & 3PL inventory levels are manage on Listing Mirror

Due to the nature of these third-party inventory sources, Listing Mirror has a limited ability to change inventory levels for these platforms. Instead, we take the inventory, and send it to the market. This is known as **Multi-Channel Fulfillment**. 

## Updating FBA & 3PL Inventory

You're unable to manually adjust your 3PL inventory levels in Listing Mirror. Instead, the providers will send the inventory levels to us ever so often. 
Amazon sends us this information every hour automatially. Other platforms such as Deliverr, and Rakuten Super Logistics send us these numbers every 15-minutes, but can be much more variable.

## Selling FBA & 3PL Inventory

Listing Mirror allows you to sell this inventory on any marketplace. We give you the tools to choose what is sold where, and which is sold first. 

1. On the menubar, click **Integrations**, followed by **Manage Integrations**. 
2. Select a marketplace
3. In the **Inventory** tab, observe the green and red boxes. 
4. Adjust the inventory sources how you see fit.

The order of your inventory sources will determine what inventory we sell first. Once you sell all your quantity on one warehouse, we'll move onto the next until the quantity is refilled.
We'll also send the sum of all inventory sources quantity to the market. If you one 10 in your warehouse, 10 in Amazon's warehouse, and 10 in a 3PL's warehouse, we'll tell the market you have 30 total.
