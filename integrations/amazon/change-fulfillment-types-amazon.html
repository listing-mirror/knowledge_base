    <h2>Learn how to switch the fulfillment type of your Amazon listings between Fulfilled By Merchant (FBM), or Fulfilled By Amazon (FBA)</h2>
        <p>
            It is important to follow the correct steps when changing the fulfillment method of your Amazon listings.
            Although Amazon allows you to switch a listing to a different type, it is not communicated to Listing Mirror.
            This can result in listings reverting to their previous type and incorrect inventory being displayed to potential buyers.
        </p>
    <div class="LM-Error">
        <p>
            Failing to follow these steps may result in data loss, and Listing Mirror support may not be able to help.
            <strong>Do not use Amazon's option to change fulfillment type while editing the listing.</strong>

    <h3>Switch your listing from FBA to FBM</h3>
    <h4>On Amazon</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Log into your <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Seller account</a>.</li>
            <li>From the hamburger menu, click <strong>Inventory</strong>, followed by <strong>Manage All Inventory</strong>.</li>
            <li>Search for an FBA SKU you want to convert to FBM, and copy the ASIN.</li>
            <li>From the hamburger menu, click <strong>Catalog</strong>, followed by <strong>Add Product</strong>.</li>
            <li>Input the ASIN and search.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Sell this product</strong>.</li>
            <li>Fill out all required information.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You're welcome to choose any SKU you prefer, but we suggest making it identical to the previous one and adding "-FBM" or "-MF" to the end, as it has worked well for our users.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>
                Confirm the fulfillment type is set to FBM, and wait for Listing Mirror to import the listing.

            We'll send your add offer request to Amazon.
            If they approve it, you should see the listing in your Amazon account, and Listing Mirror on the
            <a href="../amazon/multiple-listings-same-asin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Duplicate Listings</a> page.
            If denied, we'll let you know in your

                Please note that if you no longer wish to use the FBA listing, you will need to delete it from both Amazon and Listing Mirror.
