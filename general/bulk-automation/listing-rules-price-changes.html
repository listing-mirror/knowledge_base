    <h2>Learn how to create and manage your listing rules to increase or decrease your listing prices in Listing Mirror</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Listing Rules</strong> can be used to increase or decrease your prices based on criteria you set.
            These can help increase your profits on other markets by matching your Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) costs.
            This feature works alongside our <strong>Amazon repricing tool</strong>, so certain settings must be enabled.

        </p>
    <div class="LM-Error">
        <p>
            Before creating or running any rules, you may want to download a <strong>Price Update</strong> spreadsheet from the
            <a href="https://reflector.listingmirror.com/listing/bulk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bulk Edit Templates</a> page.
            This will create a snapshot of your current prices, in case you need to revert any changes.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Confirm your integration settings</h3>
        <p>
            Previously mentioned, you'll need to ensure your settings are properly configured to work with these rules.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Integrations</strong>, followed by <strong>Manage Integrations</strong>.</li>
            <li>Click your main Amazon integration.</li>
            <li>Enable <strong>Update Price</strong> and <strong>Sync Price</strong>.</li>
            <li>Save changes</li>
            <li>Click an integration you'd like to use the rule on.</li>
            <li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, enable <strong>Price Sync Target</strong>.</li>
                <li>Depending on the integration, this may be on the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            These settings may change your current workflow.
            Moving forward, you'll want to update your prices on Amazon Seller Central.
            From there, we'll see you changed the price, then update your marketplaces with <strong>Price Sync Target</strong> enabled accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't want to change your prices automatically, you can forego the above settings, and run the rule manually.
            After creating a rule, a <strong>Run</strong> button will appear alongside the edit and delete settings.
        </p>
    <div class="LM-Info">
        <p>
            Price rules will run automatically when we notice an Amazon price change with the above settings enabled <strong>OR</strong>, when a new listing is created.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Creating a price rule to increase or decrease prices</h3>
        <p>
            We provide two different methods of changing prices.
            You can either change them using percentages, or a fixed price.
        </p>
        <h4>Percentage</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>On the <strong>Listing Rules</strong> page, click <strong>Create</strong> under the desired marketplace.</li>
            <li>Give the rule a short title and when you'd like the rule to run.</li>
            <li>Under <strong>Rule Action</strong> select <strong>Increase Price Percent</strong></li>
            <li>Under <strong>Field Name</strong>, select <strong>Price</strong>.</li>
            <li>Under <strong>Filter Value</strong>, input your percentage.</li>
        </ol>
            <p>
                If you want to increase your price by 10%, you'd input <strong>1.10</strong> as your value.
                If you want to decrease the price by 10%, you'd input <strong>-1.10</strong> OR <strong>0.90</strong>.
            </p>
            <img src="./assets/listing-rules-increase-price-percent.png">
        <h4>Fixed</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>On the <strong>Listing Rules</strong> page, click <strong>Create</strong> under the desired marketplace.</li>
            <li>Give the rule a short title and when you'd like the rule to run.</li>
            <li>Under <strong>Rule Action</strong> select <strong>Increase Price Fixed</strong></li>
            <li>Under <strong>Field Name</strong>, select <strong>Price</strong>.</li>
            <li>Under <strong>Filter Value</strong>, input your dollar amount.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If you want to increase your price by $10, you'd input <strong>10</strong> as your value.
            If you want to decrease the price by $10, you'd input <strong>-10</strong>.
        </p>
        <img src="">
    <div class="LM-Error">
        <p>
            Including a percent symbol (%) or dollar sign ($) is not needed, and will cause the rule to not run.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Match your non-Amazon listing price to match your Amazon profits</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Match FBA Profit</strong> rule allows you to increase or decrease your prices based on your MCF fees, and listing fee of the marketplace.
            This allows you to profit on your items, even with the increased MCF costs.
        </p>
    <div class="LM-Table">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Amazon</th>
                <th>eBay</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Price: $50</td>
                <td>Price: $47</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Listing Fee: -$10</td>
                <td>Listing Fee: -$5</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>FBA Fee: -$5</td>
                <td>MCF Fee: -$7</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Profit: $35</td>
                <td>Profit: $35</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
        <p>
            From this example, you can see the eBay price is lower due to the fees associated with the Amazon item being more costly.
            We'll always match the non-Amazon marketplace price based on the profits of your Amazon sales.

            <li>Under <strong>Rule Action</strong> select <strong>Match FBA Profit</strong></li>
            <li>Under <strong>Field Name</strong>, select <strong>Price</strong>.</li>
