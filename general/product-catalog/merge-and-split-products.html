            Merging two or more <strong>products</strong> will combine them, displaying one as the parent, and the rest as the children.
            Splitting two or more <strong>products</strong> will separate them, creating individual products, or new products with similar children.

    <h3>Merging listings once products are unified</h3>
        <p>
            Merging products does not mean you're merging your market listings.
            You'll need to merge them on the <strong>Product Catalog</strong> page, or the <strong>marketplace</strong> page.
        </p>
        <h4>Product Catalog</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>From the <strong>Manage Listings</strong> page, click the newly created <strong>Product Catalog</strong></li>
            <li>Using the <strong>Market Listing</strong> box, click <strong>Merge</strong>.</li>
            <li>Read the prompt, and click <strong>Merge</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
    <div class="LM-Error">
        <p>
            Clicking <strong>Merge</strong> will delete your marketplace listings, and create them under the product variation.
