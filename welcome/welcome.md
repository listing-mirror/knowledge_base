# What Is Listing Mirror?
### Learn what our software is, and how it works for your business

Hello, and welcome to Listing Mirror! In this introduction, you're going to discover how we can partner with your business for added sales growth, and steamline the process of manging listing, inventory syncing, and order management. We pride ourselves on our ability to customize our software for all types of users, no matter the business size!

 Listing Mirror does more than copy and sync your listings to other marketplaces. We have three pillars to our software, all working together. 

 ## Pillar One: Products & Listings

Getting started with Listing Mirror, we'll import all of your listings when you add a marketplace for the first time. We use this data to build a **Product Catalogue**, that will house all your listing data, such as: titles, descriptions, images, pricing, quantity, and more. If it can be found, we will import it. Building this **Product Catalogue** allows you to then create your products on new markets, using the existing data.

## Pillar Two: Inventory Syncing

Now that you have your products imported, and brand-new listings created on the market, making sure your inventory levels are correct is crucial. From the moment you start with us, we'll begin syncing your inventory levels between channels. That means, if someone buys something on Amazon, reducing your quantity, we'll be sure to let the other markets know that you now have less quantity. Moving forward, you can update your inventory levels directly within Listing Mirror to avoid having to go to each market one by one to update them.

**NOTE:** In fringe cases, you may not want Listing Mirror to manage your inventory levels. Rest assured, you have the ability to disable this feature, should you use something else. However, we've found it to be extremely helpful to ensure that you don't oversell, and use all of our tools (such as inventory history) to better track your products. 

## Pillar Three: Order Management

Finally, we have order management. If you're using multiple channels to tell items already, you'll understand how frustrating it can be to log into each marketplace to view your orders. Moving forward, the market will send all orders to Listing Mirror, which you can then view, and fill, and add extra details - all within our software!
