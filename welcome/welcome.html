    <h3>Learn what our software is, and how it works for your business</h3>
        <p>
            Discover how we partner with your business to increase sales, and streamline listing management, inventory syncing, and order fulfillment.
            We pride ourselves on the ability to customize our software for all types of users, no matter the size!
            Listing Mirror does more than help you create your products on other market. 
            We have three pillars to our software, all working together for you.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Pillar One: Listing Management</h2>
        <p>
            First, we'll import your listings when you add a marketplace for the first time.
            We'll use this data to build a <strong>Product Catalog</strong>. 
            This will house all your listing data, such as: titles, descriptions, images, price, and more. 
            Building this <strong>Product Catalog</strong> allows you to create your products on new markets, using the existing data.

        </p>
    
<br>
    <h2>Pillar Two: Inventory Syncing</h2>
        <p>
            Then, we'll begin syncing your inventory levels between channels.
            If someone buys something on one market, we'll let other markets know you now have less quantity.
            You'll update your inventory levels directly on Listing Mirror to avoid going to each market individually to update them.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> In fringe cases, you may not want Listing Mirror to manage your inventory levels.
            You'll have the ability to disable this feature, should you use something else. 
            However, we've found it crucial to ensure that you don't oversell, and allow you to use our tools, such as inventory history, forecasting, and low stock alerts.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Pillar Three: Order Management</h2>
        <p>
            Finally, each marketplace will send your orders to us, where you can then view, fill, and manage your orders, including Fulfilled By Amazon (FBA) orders.
            If you're using multiple channels already, you'll understand how frustrating it is to log onto each marketplace to manage your orders.
