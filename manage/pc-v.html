    <h3>Learn how to create and manage your product variations across multiple markets at once</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Product Catalog</strong> can help you create and manage your variations.
            If you need to add variation to a product, or modify an existing variation, we provide the tools you need.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Create Variations</h2>
        <p>
            There are two ways to turn your products into variations.
            You can create new products, or you can merge two existing products.
        </p>
    <h3>Add Variations</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>From any <strong>Product Catalog</strong>, click the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown, followed by <strong>Add Variation</strong>.</li>
            <li>Input any required details, and click <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            You can repeat this process to add additional variations.
            Once finished, head back to the <strong>Product Catalog</strong>, and create the market listing.
        </p>
    <h3>Merge Products</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>From any <strong>Product Catalog</strong>, click the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown, followed by <strong>Merge Listings</strong>.</li>
            <li>Input a title or SKU, and click <strong>Merge</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
<br>
    <h2>Managing Data</h2>
        <p>
            The required fields are title, SKU, and price.
            Other fields will fill in the gaps that other marketplaces require, and make sure your customers have detailed information.
            To edit any field, click on the text box, and input the data.
        </p>
    <h3>Fields In Sync</h3>
        <p>
            Below each field, you'll see a green or yellow box, indicating which markets are in sync.
            Clicking the box will provide you with one of three options, depending on the marketplace.
                <ul>
                    <li>In Sync - In sync with the marketplace listing.</li>
                    <li>Out of Sync - Out of sync with the marketplace listing.</li>
                    <li>Excluded - Field does not exist on the marketplace.</li>
                </ul>
            If something is out of sync, you can select the checkbox next to the market, followed by <strong>Sync Selected</strong>.
            This will remove the market listing data and replace it with <strong>Product Catalog</strong> data.
        </p>
    <h3>Description & Bullet Points</h3>
        <p>
            In cases where a market does not support bullet points and your description is in sync with the <strong>Product Catalog</strong>, we will display your bullet points in the description.
            This feature exists for BigCommerce, Etsy, eBay, Shopify, Magento, Overstock, Google Shopping, and Wish.
        </p>
        <p>
            Variations will use the description and bullet points from the <strong>Product Catalog</strong>.
            To set a variation-specific description or bullet points, click the <strong>Override</strong> option.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Please note, not every marketplace supports variation-specific titles, descriptions, or bullet points.</strong></p>
    <h3>Identifiers</h3>
        <p>
            Some markets require a product identifier.
            By default, we show ASIN, UPC, and MPN.
            To add other types, click <strong>Add</strong>, and select an option.
            We support ASIN, UPC, GTIN, EAN, ISBN, and MPN.
        </p>
    <h3>Price</h3>
        <p>
            Regardless of which region you're syncing to, the price on the <strong>Product Catalog</strong> will always be in USD.
            If the price field is in sync with the <strong>Product Catalog</strong>, we will convert the price from USD to the region of choice using global market data.
        </p>
    <h3>Update From Amazon</h3>
        <p>
            If you're an Amazon-first seller, you may want to update your listing details based on the Amazon listing data.
            Regardless of whether you own the ASIN or not, you can pull the description, images, bullet points, and title from Amazon and update these fields automatically.
            From the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown, click <strong>Update From Amazon</strong>, and select which fields to update.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the <strong>Actions</strong> menu, click <strong>Update From Amazon</strong>.</li>
            <li>Select the fields you want to update, and click <strong>Update</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
