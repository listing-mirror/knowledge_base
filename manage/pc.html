    <h3>Learn how to edit your product data across multiple markets at once</h3>
        <p>
            Our <strong>Product Catalog</strong> allows you to manage your listings details all in one place.
            You'll be able to edit details that are similar between markets, such as titles, descriptions, images, price, and more.
            Having your listings connected to the same <strong>Product Catalog</strong> also allows us to keep your inventory sync across each marketplace.
        </p>
<br>
    <h2>Managing Data</h2>
        <p>
            The required fields are title, SKU, and price.
            Anything outside those fields will serve to fill in the gaps that other marketplaces require, and make sure your customers have detailed information.
            To edit any field, click on the text box, and input the data.
        </p>
    <h3>Fields In Sync</h3>
        <p>
            Below each field, you'll see a green or yellow box, indicating which markets are in sync with the field.
            Clicking the box will provide you with one of three options, depending on the marketplace.
                <ul>
                    <li>In Sync - This field is in sync with the marketplace listing.</li>
                    <li>Out of Sync - This field is out of sync with the marketplace listing.</li>
                    <li>Excluded - This field does not exist on the marketplace.</li>
                </ul>
            If something is out of sync, you can select the checkbox next to the market, followed by <strong>Sync Selected</strong> to sync it.
            This will remove the data on the market listing and replace it with the <strong>Product Catalog</strong> information.
        </p>
    <h3>Description & Bullet Points</h3>
        <p>
            If a market doesn't support bullet points, and your description is in sync with the <strong>Product Catalog</strong>, we'll display your bullet points in the description.
            This feature exists for BigCommerce, Etsy, eBay, Shopify, Magento, Overstock, TopHatter, Google Shopping, and Wish.
        </p>
    <h3>Identifiers</h3>
        <p>
            Some markets require you to have some kind of product identifier.
            By default, we show ASIN, UPC, and MPN.
            To add other types, click <strong>Add</strong>, and select the type you'd like to add.
        </p>
    <h3>Category</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Product Catalog</strong> will display categories based on Amazon, even if you don't use Amazon.
            You can assign these to your products, then we'll use your category mapping to give proper marketplace categories.

        </p>
    <h3>Price</h3>
        <p>
            Regardless of which region you're syncing to, the price on the <strong>Product Catalog</strong> will always be in USD.
            If your price field is in sync with the <strong>Product Catalog</strong>, we'll convert the price from USD to the region of choice using global market data.
        </p>
    <h3>Update From Amazon</h3>
        <p>
            If you're an Amazon-first seller, you may want to update your listing details based on the Amazon listing data.
            Regardless if you own the ASIN or not, you can pull in the description, images, bullet points, and title from Amazon and update these fields automatically.
            From the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown, click <strong>Update From Amazon</strong>, and select which fields you want to update.
        </p>

    <h2>Create Market Listings</h2>
        <p>
            When you're happy with the data you've input, it's time to create the listings on the market.
            On the right side, in the <strong>Market Listings</strong> box, click the plus button for each marketplace you'd like to add the product to.
            If they market requires a category, we'll ask you to select one, and put any addition data the market may need.
        </p>
    <h3>Market Listing Status</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Check Mark</strong>: Your listing is live and in sync.</li>
            <li><strong>Flame</strong>: Your listing is incomplete, or has an error.</li>
            <li><strong>Warning (merge)</strong>: Your product variations are not grouped on the marketplace, and exist as multiple variations</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clicking <strong>Merge</strong> will delete your marketplace listings, and create them under the product variation.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Plus</strong>: No market listing exists.</li>
            <li><strong>Plus (x / y created)</strong>: You've created a certain number out of the total possible variations able to be created.</li>
        </ul>
