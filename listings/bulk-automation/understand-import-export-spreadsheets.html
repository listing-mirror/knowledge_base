    <h3>Before uploading a spreadsheet</h3>
        <p>
            To ensure successful upload of the spreadsheets you download, it is important to follow the given guidelines.
            Failure to adhere to these guidelines may cause the spreadsheet to time out, fail to upload, or even result in data loss.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not adjust the columns.</li>
            <li>Do not adjust the headers.</li>
            <li>Do not fill in parent cells where the sheet is gray.</li>
            <li>Do not change the file type.</li>
            <li>Do not leave formulas in the cells. Use special paste to remove them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you encounter any issues with your spreadsheet, such as unknown errors or timeouts, we suggest uploading it with a smaller amount of data.
            This will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot any problems that may be occurring with your spreadsheet.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you encounter any errors during the upload process, you have the option to review your
