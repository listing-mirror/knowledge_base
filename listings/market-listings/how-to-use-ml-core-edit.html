        <p>
            The <strong>Market Listing Core Edit</strong> spreadsheet allows users to easily modify the specific market listing details for any desired marketplace.
            Although our <strong>Product Catalog</strong> covers the standard fields, there might be a need to edit marketplace-specific details like a Shopify handle or an eBay shipping profile.
            Additionally, it is also possible to edit a common field if marketplace-specific data, such as a unique description or title, needs to be utilized.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can access this spreadsheet on the <a href="https://reflector.listingmirror.com/listing/bulk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Import / Export</a> page.

            Because each marketplace is unique, the number of columns and header information will vary each time.
            This spreadsheet allows you to modify anything you find on the Listing tab of a market listing.

    <h3>If you need to review your marketplace errors</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Market Listing Core Edit</strong> spreadsheet also functions as a tool to identify any errors associated with your marketplace listings and provides an opportunity to resolve these issues.
            The last six columns of the spreadsheet display all errors, warnings, and incomplete messages that may be present in a listing.
            Armed with this information, you can make the necessary modifications to your marketplace listing data to address and resolve any errors.
