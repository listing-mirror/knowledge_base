## Mirror Listings

- **Getting Started | Category Mapping**
    
    - [Explain how to use category mapping.](https://support.listingmirror.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012837672)

        - Explain that new eBay sellers will need to set up business policies on eBay. Veterns to eBay will have their policies import.
        - Errors will include: Valid shipping, payment, return profile. (Find examples of these on client listings for word-for-word phrasing.)
        - Explain how to set max quantity, as most people can't sell all of their quantity without being an established seller. 
    - Common Pitfalls | Missing Category Fields
