    <h3>Learn how to map Amazon categories you use to be similar to other markets</h3>
        <p>
            After an Amazon listing is in Listing Mirror, we'll map its assigned category to the most relevant category on another marketplace.
            You're able to change these at any point from the <strong>Category Mapping</strong> page.

        </p>
        <p>
            Please note, these will only apply to new listings.
            No existing listings will be changed.

    <h2>Default Category Mapping</h2>
        <p>
            If there's a category you want your products assigned to, you can select a default for each marketplace.
            Any product that doesn't have a specific mapping will be assigned this category.

            You're provided with every category possibility you have on Amazon.
            Click <strong>Override</strong>, and select the desired category.
